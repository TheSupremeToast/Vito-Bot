[Chorus: 24kGoldn]
Why you always in a mood? Fuckin' 'round, actin' brand new

I ain't tryna tell you what to do, but try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules

[Verse 1: iann dior]
I could never get attached
When I start to feel, I unattach
Somehow I always end up feeling bad
Baby, I am not your dad, it's not all you want from me
I just want your company
Girl, it's obvious, elephant in the room
And we're a part of it, don't act so confused
And you love startin' it, now I'm in a mood
Now we arguin' in my bedroom

[Pre-Chorus: iann dior]
We play games of love to avoid the depression
We been here before and I won't be your victim

Why you always in a mood? Fuckin' 'round, actin' brand new

I ain't tryna tell you what to do, but try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules

[Verse 2: 24kGoldn]
So why you tryin' to fake your love on the regular
When you could be blowin' up just like my cellular?
I won't ever let a shorty go and set me up
Only thing I need to know is if you wet enough
I'm talking slick back, kick back, gang sippin' fourties
You keep playin', not another day with you, shorty
Mismatched fits, that was way before you know me
Got a lot of love, well, you better save it for me

[Pre-Chorus: iann dior, iann dior & 24kGoldn]
We play games of love to avoid the depression
We been here before and I won't be your victim

[Chorus: 24kGoldn]
Why you always in a mood? Fuckin' 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do, but try to play it cool

VALENTINO Lyrics[Chorus]
I don't want a valentine, I just want Valentino
I just want the neck, I poke her face like a casino
Deep throat, know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some mo', she just can't seem to keep her knees closed
I don't want a valentine, I just want Valentino
I just want the neck, I poke her face like a casino
Deep throat, know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some mo', she just can't seem to keep her knees closed


[Verse]
I fuck her long, ain't no Minute Maid, my diamonds lemonade
Flexin' hard, call me Popeye, wallet filled with spinach, ayy
Cut you off on the interstate, I'm first to finish, ayy
I'm a young, rich nigga, bitch, it's always been that way
To the grave, might just be tomorrow, might just be today
So I always live it up, we poppin' bottles, poppin' K's
Gucci shades from my bougie bitch, I ain't even had to pay
Had to put on for the team and had to put on for the Bay
I'm still fly when I wear Robin's wings, I can't stay in one place
Russian Creams in my rocket ship, we go to outer space
Mask off, mask on, fuck it, I can't catch a case
Blast off, blast off, see the stars up in the Wraith
You can't get into the crib because the mansion got a gate
You can't come into my section, I'm gon' put you into place
If your club goin' up, you bet I'm sliding like it's chess
And I think I fell in love, she shook that ass up in my face
[Chorus]
I don't want a valentine, I just want Valentino
I just want the neck, I poke her face like a casino
Deep throat, know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some mo', she just can't seem to keep her knees closed
I don't want a valentine, I just want Valentino
I just want the neck, I poke her face like a casino
Deep throat, know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some mo', she just can't seem to keep her knees closed

[Post-Chorus]
She just can't seem to keep her knees closed
She just can't seem to keep her knees closed

[Chorus]
⁠⁠I don't want a valentine, I just want Valentino
I just want the neck, I poke her face like a casino
Deep throat, know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some mo', she just can't seem to keep her knees closed
I don't want a valentine, I just want Valentino
I just want the neck, I poke her face like a casino
Deep throat, know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some mo', she just can't seem to keep her knees closed23Embed

CITY OF ANGELS Lyrics[Chorus]
I sold my soul to the devil for designer
They said, "Go to hell," but I told 'em I don’t wanna
If you know me well, then you know that I ain't goin', ’cause
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna die young
The city of angels where I have my fun
Don't wanna die young
When I'm gone, remember all I've done, 'one

[Verse]
We’ve had our fun, ’un
But now I'm done, ’one
'Cause you crazy (Yeah), I can't take it (No)
Just wanted to see you naked
Heard time like money, can't waste it
What’s the price of fame? 'Cause I can taste it
So I'm chasin' (Yeah), and I'm facin'
A little Hennessy, it might be good for me

[Chorus]
I sold my soul to the devil for designer
They said, "Go to hell," but I told 'em I don't wanna

The city of angels where I have my fun
Don't wanna die young

How many times you gon' call me?

Oh my God, why is shawty tryna test me?
Too turnt up in the back of the jetstream (Yeah)
Can't be cuffed, but she tryin' to arrest me
Lyin' to impress me, dyin' to forget me

You keep on ringin' me, goes on and on

Checking your temperature, thermometer

Super pretty chocolate nigga, she say she can tell
Make her feel like I'm from heaven, but I still put up through hell
They wasn't 'bout what I was 'bout
Them niggas ain't rock the way that I rocked
I realized they ain't mean me well (Let's go)
Told her don't call my phone with all that nice shit (Oh no)
Double C's on the belt correlate the ice hit (Bling, bling)
Gettin' to know me right now is highly unlikely
'Cause I still remember the days when people like you ain't like me, bitch

[Pre-Chorus: 24kGoldn & DaBaby]
Seems like lately (But fuck that, you know)
You're Coco crazy (I ain't even trippin', you know what I mean? I'm doin' good without you)

3, 2, 1 Lyrics[Chorus]
Three sides to the story
Yours and mine and the goddamn truth, girl
Two lies that you told me
Say you love me and you hate me, I don't know what to do, girl
One thing’s for sure
You can back that ass up and, baby, I want more
But I need to know
Can you make me a promise to always be honest?

[Verse 1]
Fucked up, you put my heart in a headlock
Usually, it's me that only wanna make the bed rock
Stuck up, like a robbery with red dots
Really no surprise you tellin' lies to make my head hot

[Pre-Chorus]
You know what they say (What they say)
Every dog has his day, every bitch wanna play with me (Woo, woo)
You should be ashamed (Ashamed)
’Cause I would feel the same if I did what you did to me

[Chorus]
Three sides to the story
Yours and mine and the goddamn truth, girl
Two lies that you told me
Say you love me and you hate me, I don't know what to do, girl
One thing's for sure
You can back that ass up and, baby, I want more
But I need to know
Can you make me a promise to always be honest?
[Verse 2]
Started with a kiss (Kiss), ended with a dub (Dub)
Better if you leave 'cause I feel better when you gone
Diamonds on my wrist (Wrist), feelings getting numb (Numb)
Thought you knew it all, so baby, why you playing dumb?

[Pre-Chorus]
You know what they say (They say)
Every dog has his day, every bitch wanna play with me (Woo, woo)
You should be ashamed (Ashamed)
'Cause I would feel the same if I did what you did to me

[Chorus]
Three sides to the story
Yours and mine and the goddamn truth, girl
Two lies that you told me
Say you love me and you hate me, I don't know what to do, girl

You know it's more fun when you papered out

I hold up my wrist, that's a Bentley machine
Ain't havin' issues with gettin' fettuccine
You fuckin' King Pluto, you get what you dreamin'
Mop up my top, got me splashin' codeine
Swap out your wardrobe, you fuckin' a king
Came out the bottom like 400 Juvie
Put a switch on it and go make a movie
Trippin' off ecstasy, I'm totally polluted
Bitches on bitches, they done my recruitin'
Hoes, they goin' both ways
They get it poppin' on good medication (Good medication)
Diamonds on me, Bobby Brown (Diamonds on me)
Diamonds be dancin' on me, MJ (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
I put them Rolex diamonds on my trigger finger, walk 'em down, leave a nigga in the cold (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
I put the Bentley Spur on a cha-cha, had to turn up another nigga ho (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
And she do whatever a nigga say, I'm controllin' my bitches without usin' a remote (Turn it up)
I done came from the bottom, I started with nothin', had to go out and get me a Draco
I done smashed on an R&B star in the trenches, these bitches gon' do what I say so (Do what I say so)
Hop in my shit, you know damn well I'm lit, I've been fuckin' these thotties, I'm loaded and rich (Loaded and rich)

Can you turn my headphones up? (Yup)
D.A. got that dope
Uh

[Chorus]
Dropped outta college, but bitch, I'm still ballin'
I know that you jealous a little bit
She seen my picture and heard I'm a singer
If I pull it out, then she kissin' it
I'm taking chances and chasing advances
If life is a bet, then I'm riskin' it
Skrrt off the block in a Fisker whip
You know that I had to figure it out
What would you do for the clout? (Clout)
Dropped outta college, but bitch, I'm still ballin'
I know that you jealous a little bit

[Verse]
Cry to your mama
You don't want no drama
Even as a kid you was sensitive
Flex on the 'Gram, you ain't really rich
Everyone know that you rented it
Money, I'm countin' for twenty-four hours
It's harder to save when it's comin' in
Can't make a clone 'cause I'm one-of-one
Lil' boy, you ain't even one of them
I hit the Bowflex, got my muscle up
Two twins, tell 'em double dutch
Two twins, had to double cup
And they both dance, told 'em, "Fuck it up"
Frostbite, Fortnite
Foreign cars on a foreign line
Foreign broads and they all fine
Yeah, yeah, yeah, they all mine
Switch it up, money dance
Workin' smart, makin' bands
Tryna see you drop and get naked, yeah
Ten, ten, twenties, baby, tryna see you shake it, yeah
[Chorus]
Dropped outta college, but bitch, I'm still ballin'
I know that you jealous a little bit
She seen my picture and heard I'm a singer
If I pull it out, then she kissin' it
I'm taking chances and chasing advances
If life is a bet, then I'm riskin' it
Skrrt off the block in a Fisker whip

'Cause if you're in love, then I shouldn't be here
It's never enough, so I gotta leave you now
Ooh-woah-oh, oh-oh

Would you walk eight thousand miles just to make me smile on a rainy Wednesday?
If so, then you gots to go, it ain't mutual and I'm not pretending

Shoulda kno-o-own
