Fly Me to the Moon Lyrics[Verse 1]
Fly me to the moon
Let me play among the stars
And let me see what spring is like
On a-Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand
In other words, baby, kiss me

[Verse 2]
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Fill my heart with song
Let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, in other words
I love you94Embed

My Way Lyrics[Verse 1]
And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
I traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

[Verse 2]
Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

[Verse 3]
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all, and I stood tall
And did it my way
[Verse 4]
I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh, no, oh, no, not me
I did it my way

[Verse 5]
For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

[Outro]
Yes, it was my way64Embed

That’s Life Lyrics[Verse 1]
That's life (That's life), that's what all the people say
You're riding high in April, shot down in May
But I know I'm gonna change that tune
When I'm back on top, back on top in June
I said, that's life (That's life), and as funny as it may seem
Some people get their kicks, stompin' on a dream
But I don't let it, let it get me down
'Cause this fine old world, it keeps spinning around

[Chorus]
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and out, and I know one thing
Each time I find myself flat on my face
I pick myself up and get back in the race

[Verse 2]
That's life (That's life), I tell ya, I can't deny it
I thought of quitting, baby
But my heart just ain't gonna buy it
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try
I'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly

[Chorus]
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and out, and I know one thing
Each time I find myself laying flat on my face
I just pick myself up and get back in the race
[Outro]
That's life (That's life), that's life and I can't deny it
Many times I thought of cutting out but my heart won't buy it
But if there's nothing shaking come this here July
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball and die
My, my18Embed

New York, New York Lyrics[Verse 1]
Start spreading the news, I'm leaving today
I want to be a part of it: New York, New York
These vagabond shoes, are longing to stray
Right through the very heart of it: New York, New York

[Hook]
I wanna wake up in a city that doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill, top of the heap

[Verse 2]
These little town blues, are melting away
I'll make a brand new start of it in old New York

[Hook]
If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere
It's up to you, New York, New York

[Verse 3]
New York, New York
I want to wake up in a city that never sleeps
And find I'm a number one, top of the list
King of the hill, a number one

[Outro]
These little town blues, oh, are melting away
I'm gonna make a brand new start of it in old New York
And if I can make it there, I'm gonna make it anywhere
It's up to you, New York, New York17Embed

The Girl From Ipanema (Garota De Ipanema) Lyrics[Frank Sinatra]
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
Each one she passes goes "ah"

[Frank Sinatra]
When she walks, she's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes, each one she passes goes  "ooh"

[Frank Sinatra]
But I watch her so sadly
How can I tell her I love her
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me

[Frank Sinatra]
Tall, (and) tan, (and) young, (and) lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, I smile but she doesn't see
(doesn't see)

[Antonio Carlos Jobim]
Olha que coisa mais linda mais cheia de graça
Ela menina que vem e que passa
Num doce balanço a caminho do mar
[Antonio Carlos Jobim]
Moça do corpo dourado do sol de ipanema
O seu balançado mais que um poema
A coisa mais linda que eu j vi passar..

[Frank Sinatra]
Ooh, but I watch her so sadly

[Antonio Carlos Jobim]
Ah, Porque tudo to triste

[Frank Sinatra]
Yes, I would give my heart gladly

[Frank Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim]
But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me

[Frank Sinatra]
Tall, tan, young, lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, I smile but she doesn't see

[Antonio Carlos Jobim]
Por causa do amor
[Frank Sinatra]
She just doesn't see

[Antonio Carlos Jobim]
Nem olha para mim

[Frank Sinatra]
She never sees me

Somethin’ Stupid Lyrics[Vocals: Frank Sinatra & Nancy Sinatra]

[Verse 1]
I know I stand in line until you think you have the time to spend an evening with me
And if we go some place to dance, I know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with me

[Chorus 1]
Then afterwards we drop into a quiet little place and have a drink or two
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, "I love you"
I can see it in your eyes, that you despise the same old lies you heard the night before
And though it's just a line to you, for me it's true, and never seemed so right before

[Verse 2]
I practice every day to find some clever lines to say to make the meaning come true
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late, and I'm alone with you

[Chorus 2]
The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and, oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, "I love you"

[Chorus 2]
The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and, oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, "I love you"

[Outro]
"I love you"
"I love you"

The Way You Look Tonight LyricsSome day, when I'm awfully low
When the world is cold
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight

Yes, you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft
There is nothing for me, but to love you
And the way you look tonight

With each word, your tenderness grows
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart

Lovely; never, ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it? Cause I love you
Just the way you look tonight

[Instrumental]

And that laugh that wrinkles your nose
It touches my foolish heart

Lovely, Don't you ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it? Cause I love you
A-just the way you look tonight
Mm-Mm, Mm-Mm
Just the way you look tonight7Embed

Come Fly with Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away
If you can use some exotic booze, there's a bar in far Bombay
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away

[Verse 2]
Come fly with me, let's float down to Peru
In llama land, there's a one man band, and he'll toot his flute for you
Come fly with me, let's take off in the blue

[Chorus]
Once I get you up there, where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide, starry-eyed
Once I get you up there, I'll be holding you so near
You may hear angels cheer 'cause we're together

[Verse 3]
Weather wise, it's such a lovely day
Just say the words and we'll beat the birds down to Acapulco Bay
It's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
Once I get you up there, where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide, starry-eyed
Once I get you up there, I'll be holding you so near
You may hear angels cheer 'cause we're together
[Verse 3]
Weather wise, it's such a lovely day
You just say the words and we'll beat the birds down to Acapulco Bay
It's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly

Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas Lyrics[Verse 1]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
Next year all our troubles
Will be out of sight

[Verse 2]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
Next year all our troubles
Will be miles away

[Bridge]
Once again, as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Will be near to us once more

[Verse 3]
Someday soon we all will be together
If the fates allow
Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now2Embed

I’ve Got You Under My Skin Lyrics[Verse]
I've got you under my skin
I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin
I tried so not to give in
I said to myself, 'this affair never will go so well'
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know so well
I've got you under my skin

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'd sacrifice anything, come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear

[Chorus 1]
"Don't you know little fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality"
But each time that I do, just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I would sacrifice anything, come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear
[Chorus 2]
"Don't you know, little fool, you never can win?
Why not use your mentality? Step up, wake up to reality"
But each time I do, just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin
Yes, I've got you, under my skin14Embed
