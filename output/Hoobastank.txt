The Reason Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm not a perfect person
There's many things I wish I didn't do
But I continue learning
I never meant to do those things to you
And so I have to say before I go
That I just want you to know

[Chorus]
I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry that I hurt you
It's something I must live with every day
And all the pain I put you through
I wish that I could take it all away
And be the one who catches all your tears
That's why I need you to hear

[Chorus]
I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you
[Bridge]
And the reason is you
And the reason is you
And the reason is you

[Breakdown]
I'm not a perfect person
I never meant to do those things to you
And so I have to say before I go
That I just want you to know

[Chorus]
I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you

[Outro]
I’ve found a reason to show
A side of me you didn’t know
A reason for all that I do
And the reason is you50Embed

Crawling In The Dark Lyrics[Verse 1]
I will dedicate and sacrifice my every
Thing for just a second's worth of how my story's ending
And I wish I could know if the directions that I take
And all the choices that I make won't end up all for nothing

[Chorus]
Show me what it's for, make me understand it
I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer
Is there something more than what I've been handed?
I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer

[Verse 2]
Help me carry on, assure me it's OK to
Use my heart and not my eyes to navigate the darkness
Will the ending be ever coming suddenly?
Will I ever get to see the ending to my story?

[Chorus]
Show me what it's for, make me understand it
I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer
Is there something more than what I've been handed?
I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer

[Rap]
So when and how will I know?
[Bridge]
How much further do I have to go?
And how much longer 'til I finally know?
`Cause I'm looking and I just can't see what's in front of me
In front of me

[Chorus]
Show me what it's for, make me understand it
I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer
Is there something more than what I've been handed?
I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer2Embed

Out Of Control Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've done everything as you say
I've followed your rules without question
I thought it would help me see things clearly
But instead of helping me to see
I look around and it's like I'm blinded

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control

[Chorus]
Where should I go? What should I do?
I don't understand what you want from me
'Cause I don't know, if I can trust you
I don't understand what you want from me

[Verse 2]
I feel like I'm spinning out of control
Try to focus but everything's twisted
And all alone I thought you would be there
To let me know I'm not alone
But in fact that's exactly what I was

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
[Chorus]
Where should I go? What should I do?
I don't understand what you want from me
'Cause I don't know, if I can trust you
Or all of the things you've said to me

[Bridge]
I may never know the answer
To this endless mystery
Where should I go? What should I do?
I don't understand what you want from me

[Interlude]
Is it a mystery? Is it a mystery?
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control

[Pre-Chorus]
Spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control

[Chorus]
Where should I go? What should I do?
I don't understand what you want from me
'Cause I don't know, if I can trust you
Or all the things you've said to me
[Outro]
And I may never know the answer
To this endless mystery
Where should I go? What should I do?
I don't understand what you want from me
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control1Embed

Same Direction Lyrics[Verse 1]
Whenever I step outside
Somebody claims to see the light
It seems to me that all of us have lost our patience
Cause everyone thinks they're right
And nobody thinks that there just might
Be more than one road to our final destination

[Chorus]
But I'm not ever gonna know if I'm right or wrong
Cause we're all going in the same direction
And I'm not sure which way to go
Because all along, we've been going in the same direction

[Verse 2]
I'm tired of playing games
Of looking for someone else to blame
For all the holes in answers that are clearly showing
For something to fill the space
Was all of the time I spent a waste
Cause so many choices point the same way I was going

[Chorus]
But I'm not ever gonna know if I'm right or wrong
Cause we're all going in the same direction
And I'm not sure which way to go
Because all along, we've been going in the same direction
Going in the same direction
Same direction (same direction)
[Verse 3]
So why does there only have to be one correct philosophy?
I don't wanna go and follow you just to end up like one of them
And why are you always telling me what you want me to believe?
I'd like to think that I can
Go my own way and meet you in the end
Go my own way and meet you in the end

[Chorus]
I'm not ever gonna know if I'm right or wrong
Cause we're all going in the same direction
And I'm not sure which way to go
Because all along, we've been going in the same direction
Going in the same direction
Going in the same direction
Same direction (same direction)Embed

Running Away Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't want you to give it all up
And leave your own life collecting dust
And I don't want you to feel sorry for me
You never gave us a chance to be
And I don't need you to be by my side
To tell me that everything's alright
I just wanted you to tell me the truth
You know I'd do that for you

[Chorus]
So why are you running away?
Why are you running away?

[Verse 2]
I did enough to show you that I
Was willing to give and sacrifice
And I was the one who was lifting you up
When you thought your life had, had enough
And when I get close, you turn away
There's nothing that I can do or say
So now I need you to tell me the truth
You know I'd do that for you

[Chorus]
So why are you running away?
Why are you running away?
[Bridge]
Is it me? (Is it me) Is it you? (Is it you)
Nothing that (Nothing that)
I can do (I can do)
To make you (To make you)
Change your mind
Is it me? Is it you?
(Why do you run away won't you tell)
Nothing that I can do
Is it a waste of time?
(Why do you run away)
Is it me? Is it you?
Nothing that I can do
To make you change your mind, no

[Outro]
So why are you running away?
Why are you running away?
(What is it I have to say...)
So why are you running away?
(...to make you admit you're afraid?)
Why are you running away?1Embed

What Happened To Us? Lyrics[Verse 1]
I thought it was too good to be true
I found somebody who understands me
Someone who would help me to get through
And fill an emptiness I had inside me
But you kept inside and I just denied
Some things that we should have both said
I knew it was too good to be true
Cause I'm the only one who understands me

[Chorus]
What happened to us?
We used to be so perfect
Now we're lost and lonely
What happened to us?
And deep inside I wonder
Did I lose my only?

[Verse 2]
Remember they thought we were too young
To really know what it takes to make it
But we had survived off what we have done
So we could show them all that they're mistaken
But who could have known
The lies that would grow
Until we could see right through them
Remember they knew we were too young
We still don't know what it takes to make it
[Chorus]
What happened to us?
We used to be so perfect
Now we're lost and lonely
What happened to us?
And deep inside I wonder
Did I lose my only one?

[Verse 3]
We could've made it work
We could've found a way
We should've done our best to see another day
But we kept it all inside until it was too late
And now we're both alone
The consequence we pay for throwing it all away
For throwing it all away

[Chorus]
What happened to us?
We used to be so perfect
Now we're lost and lonely
What happened to us?
And deep inside I wonder
Did I lose my only?

[Outro]
What happened to us?
What happened to us?
What happened to us?
What happened to us?Embed

If I Were You Lyrics[Verse 1]
You seem to find the dark when everything is bright
You look for all that's wrong instead of all that's right
Does it feel good to you to rain on my parade
You never say a word unless it's to complain
It's driving me insane

If I were you
Holding the world right in my hands
The first thing I'd do
Is thank the stars for all that I have
If I were you

Look what surrounds you now
More than you ever dreamed
Have you forgotten just how hard it used to be
So what's it going to take
For you to realize
It all could go away in one blink of an eye
It happens all the time

If I were you
Holding the world right in my hands
The first thing I'd do
Is thank the stars above
Tell the ones I love
That I do
Yea if I were you
Whoa yea if I were you
Yea if I were you
Whoa if I were you

So what's it going to take
For you to realize
It all could go away in one blink of an eye
It happens all the time

If I were you
Holding the world right in my hands
The first thing I'd do
Is thank the stars above
For the world I love
Take a breath and enjoy the view
Live the life that I've wanted to

If I were you
If I were you
If I were youEmbed

Disappear Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's a pain that sleeps inside
It sleeps with just one eye
And awakens the moment that you leave
Though I try to look away
The pain it still remains
Only leaving when you're next to me

Do you know, that everytime you're near
Everybody else seems far away
So can you come and make them disappear
Make them disappear and we can stay

So I stand and look around
Distracted by the sounds
Of everyone and everything I see
And I search through every face
Without a single trace, of the person
The person that I need

Do you know, that everytime you're near
Everybody else seems far away
So can you come and make them disappear
Make them disappear and we can stay

Can you make them disappear?
Make them disappear
There's a pain that sleeps inside
Sleeps with just one eye
And awakens, the moment that you leave
And I search through every face
Without a single trace, of the person
The person that I need

Do you know, that everytime you're near
Everybody else seems far away
So can you come and make them disappear
Make them disappear and we can stayEmbed

More Beautiful Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't ever think you're broken or not good enough
Cause all the things you wanna fix are things that I love
I'll tell you now, there's nothing for your to hide
I know who are inside, you're all that I need
Don't listen to the voices saying otherwise
Look into my eyes, listen to me

[Chorus]
You have never been more beautiful
Than you are now and you don't even know
Don't be afraid of being vulnerable
'Cause you have never been, never been more beautiful

[Verse 2]
You don't see yourself the same anymore
And say I don't look at you like I did before
Those imperfections give you insecurities
But they fit you perfectly, don't change a thing
They make you who are and you are who I want
I'm begging from my heart, so won't you listen to me?

[Chorus]
You have never been more beautiful
Than you are now and you don't even know
Don't be afraid of being vulnerable
'Cause you have never been more beautiful
You have never been more beautiful
Than you are now and you don't even know
Don't be afraid of being vulnerable
'Cause you have never been more beautiful
[Bridge]
Just show me what you've covered
It'll make me only want you more
'Cause I'm aching to discover
If there's any other scars I haven't seen before
It's true I don't look at you like I did before
'Cause when I look at you now, I want you even more

[Chorus]
You have never been more beautiful
Than you are now and you don't even know
Don't be afraid of being vulnerable
'Cause you have never been more beautiful
You have never been more beautiful
Than you are now when the real you shows
There's no shame in being vulnerable
'Cause you have never been, never been more beautiful
You have never been more beautifulEmbed

Inside Of You Lyrics[Verse 1]
It seems so obvious
There's something up with us
I swear I feel it
From across the room
So can I ask you this
Not to be forward miss
But I think I'll kill myself
If I never knew

What do I have to do
To get inside of you
To get inside of you
'Cause I love the way you move
When I'm inside of you
When I'm inside of you

Just ask and I will do
Anything you want me to
There is no limit
To how far I will go
And I'm sure I can't pretend
To be a gentleman
But before I began
I just gotta know
(Just gotta know)
(Just gotta know)
What do I have to do
To get inside of you
To get inside of you
'Cause I love the way you move
When I'm inside of you
When I'm inside of you

For now I'll play the game
And I'm waiting for your move
But I've got to say
That I never lose

What do I have to do
To get inside of you
To get inside of you
What do I have to do
To get inside of you
To get inside of you
'Cause I love the way you move
When I'm inside of you
When I'm inside of you
When I'm inside of you
You
You

When I'm inside of youEmbed
