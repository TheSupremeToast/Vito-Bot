Should I Stay or Should I Go Lyrics[Intro]
Oh! Hola!

[Verse 1]
Darling, you got to let me know
Should I stay or should I go?
If you say that you are mine
I'll be here 'till the end of time
So you got to let me know
Should I stay or should I go?

[Verse 2]
It's always tease, tease, tease
You're happy when I'm on my knees
One day it's fine and next it's black
So if you want me off your back
Well, come on and let me know
Should I stay or should I go?

[Chorus]
Should I stay or should I go now?
Should I stay or should I go now?
If I go, there will be trouble
And if I stay it will be double
So come on and let me know
[Verse 3]
This indecision's bugging me (Esta indecisión me molesta)
If you don't want me, set me free (Si no me quieres, librarme)
Exactly whom I'm supposed to be (Dígame que tengo ser)
Don't you know which clothes even fit me? (Sabes que ropa me "quedrá"?)
Come on and let me know (Me tienes que decir)
Should I cool it or should I blow? (Me debo ir o quedarme?)
Split

[Bridge]
(Doble! ¿Me frio o lo soplo?)
(Esperda, rrattarrattattaa...)

[Chorus]
Should I stay or should I go now? (Yo me enfrío o lo soplo)
Should I stay or should I go now? (Yo me enfrío o lo soplo)
If I go there will be trouble (Si me voy va a haber peligro)
And if I stay it will be double (Si me quedo sera el doble)
So ya gotta let me know (Me tienes que decir)
Should I cool it or should I blow? (Tengo frío por los ojos)
Should I stay or should I go now? (Tengo frío por los ojos)
If I go there will be trouble (Si me voy va haber peligro)
And if I stay it will be double (Si me quedo será el doble)
So ya gotta let me know (Me tienes que decir)
Should I stay or should I go?41Embed

Rock the Casbah Lyrics[Verse 1]
Now the king told the boogie men
You have to let that raga drop
The oil down the desert way
Has been shaken to the top
The Sheikh he drove his Cadillac
He went a' cruisin' down the ville
The Muezzin was a'standing
On the radiator grille

[Chorus]
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah

[Verse 2]
By order of the prophet
We ban that boogie sound
Degenerate the faithful
With that crazy Casbah sound
But the Bedouin they brought out
The electric kettle drum
The local guitar picker
Got his guitar pickin' thumb
As soon as the Shareef
Cleared the square
They began to wail
[Chorus]
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah

[Verse 3]
Now over at the temple
Oh! They really pack 'em in
The in crowd say it's cool
To dig this chanting thing
But as the wind changed direction
And the temple band took five
The crowd caught a whiff
Of that crazy Casbah jive

[Chorus]
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah

[Verse 4]
The king called up his jet fighters
He said "You better earn your pay
Drop your bombs between the minarets
Down the Casbah way"
As soon as the Shareef was
Chauffeured outta there
The jet pilots tuned to
The cockpit radio blare
As soon as the Shareef was
Out of their hair
The jet pilots wailed
[Chorus]
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah

[Outro]
(Shareef don't like it)
Thinks it’s not kosher
(Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah)
(Shareef don't like it)
Fundamentally can’t take it
(Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah)
(Shareef don't like it)
You know he really hates it
(Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah)
(Shareef don't like it)
Really, really hates it20Embed

London Calling Lyrics[Verse 1]
London calling to the faraway towns
Now war is declared and battle come down
London calling to the underworld
Come outta' the cupboard, ya' boys and girls
London calling, now don't look to us
Phony Beatlemania has bitten the dust
London calling, see we ain't got no swing
'Cept for the ring of that truncheon thing

[Chorus]
The ice age is coming, the sun's zoomin' in
Meltdown expected, the wheat is growin' thin
Engines stop running, but I have no fear
Cause London is drownin', I, live by the river

[Verse 2]
(London calling) to the imitation zone
Forget it, brother, you can go it alone
London calling to the zombies of death
Quit holdin' out and draw another breath
London calling and I don't want to shout
But while we were talking I saw you noddin' out
London calling, see we ain't got no Hyde
'Cept for that one with the yellowy eyes
[Chorus]
The ice age is coming, the sun's zoomin' in
Engines stop running, the wheat is growin' thin
A nuclear error, but I have no fear
Cause London is drowning, I, I live by the river

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
The ice age is coming, the sun's zoomin' in
Engines stop running, the wheat is growin' thin
A nuclear error, but I have no fear
Cause London is drowning, I, I live by the river

[Bridge]
Now get this

[Verse 3]
(London calling), yes, I was there, too
And ya' know what they said? Well, some of it was true!
(London calling) at the top of the dial
And after all this, won't you give me a smile?
(London calling)

I never felt so much alike alike alike...35Embed

Spanish Bombs Lyrics[Verse 1]
Spanish songs in Andalucía
The shooting site in the days of '39
Oh, please, leave the ventana open
Federico Lorca is dead and gone
Bullet holes in the cemetery walls
The black cars of the Guardia Civil
Spanish bombs on the Costa Rica
I'm flyin' in on a DC 10 tonight

[Chorus]
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te acuerda oh, mi corazón
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te acuerda oh mi corazón

[Verse 2]
Spanish weeks in my disco casino
The freedom fighters died upon the hill
They sang the red flag, they wore the black one
After they died it was Mockingbird Hill
Back home the buses went up in flashes
The Irish tomb was drenched in blood
Spanish bombs shatter the hotels
My señorita's rose was nipped in the bud
[Chorus]
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te acuerda oh, mi corazón
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te acuerda oh mi corazón

[Verse 3]
The hillsides ring with "Free the people"
Or can I hear the echo from the days of '39?
With trenches full of poets, the ragged army
Fixin' bayonets to fight the other line
Spanish bombs rock the province
I'm hearin' music from another time
Spanish bombs on the Costa Brava
I'm flyin' in on a DC 10 tonight

[Chorus]
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te acuerda oh mi corazón
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te acuerda oh, mi corazón

[Outro]
Oh, mi corazón
Oh, mi corazón

Mandolina, oh, mi corazón

Straight to Hell Lyrics[Verse 1]
If you can play on fiddle
How's about a British jig and reel?
Speaking King's English in quotation
As railhead towns feel the steel mills rust
Water froze in the generation
Clear as winter ice
This is your paradise

[Chorus]
There ain't no need for ya
There ain't no need for ya
Go straight to hell boys
Go straight to hell boys

[Verse 2]
Wanna join in a chorus
Of the Amerasian blues?
When it's Christmas out in Ho Chi Minh City
Kiddie say papa papa papa papa papa-san take me home
See me got photo photo
Photograph of you
And Mamma Mamma Mamma-san
Of you and Mamma Mamma Mamma-san
Let me tell you 'bout your blood bamboo kid
It ain't Coca-Cola, it's rice
[Chorus]
Straight to hell, boy
Go straight to hell boy
Go straight to hell boys
Go straight to hell boys

[Bridge]
Oh Papa-san
Please take me home
Oh Papa-san
Everybody they wanna go home
So Mamma-san says

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 3]
You wanna play mind-crazed banjo
On the druggy-drag ragtime U.S.A.?
In Parkland International
Ha, Junkiedom U.S.A
Where procaine proves the purest rock man groove
And rat poison
The volatile Molotov says

[Interlude]
Hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah
Straight to hell
[Verse 4]
Can you cough it up loud and strong?
The immigrants
They wanna sing all night long
It could be anywhere
Most likely could be any frontier
Any hemisphere
No man's land
There ain't no asylum here
King Solomon he never lived 'round here

[Outro]
Straight to hell boy
Go straight to hell boy
Go straight to hell boys
Go straight to hell boys
Oh Pappa-san, please take me home
Everybody they wanna go home now9Embed

The Guns of Brixton Lyrics[Intro: Joe Strummer]
(Oh, yeah)
Hey, Paul

[Verse 1]
When they kick at your front door
How you gonna come?
With your hands on your head
Or on the trigger of your gun?
When the law break in
How you gonna go?
Shot down on the pavement
Or waiting in death row?

[Chorus]
You can crush us
You can bruise us
But you'll have to answer to
Oh, the guns of Brixton

[Pre-Verse]
The money feels good
And your life you like it well
But surely your time will come
As in heaven, as in hell
[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
You see, he feels like Ivan
Born under the Brixton sun
His game is called survivin'
At the end of The Harder They Come
You know it means no mercy
They caught him with a gun
No need for the Black Maria
Goodbye to the Brixton sun

[Chorus]
You can crush us
You can bruise us
But you'll have to answer to
Oh, the guns of Brixton

[Verse 1]
When they kick at your front door
How you gonna come?
With your hands on your head
Or on the trigger of your gun?

[Chorus]
You can crush us
You can bruise us
You can even shoot us
But, oh the guns of Brixton
[Verse 3]
Shot down on the pavement
Waiting in death row
His game was survivin'
As in heaven, as in hell

[Chorus]
You can crush us
You can bruise us
But you'll have to answer to
Oh, the guns of Brixton
Oh, guns of Brixton
Oh, guns of Brixton

Lost in the Supermarket Lyrics[Chorus]
I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
Guaranteed personality

[Verse 1]
I wasn't born, so much as I fell out
Nobody seemed to notice me
We had a hedge back home in the suburbs
Over which I never could see
I heard the people who live on the ceiling
Scream and fight, most scarily
Hearing that noise was my first ever feelin'
That's how it's been, all around me

[Chorus]
I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
Guaranteed personality

[Verse 2]
I'm all tuned in, I see all the programs
I save coupons from packets of tea
I've got my giant hit, discotheque album
I empty a bottle, I feel a bit free
The kids in halls and the pipes in the walls
Making noises for company
Long distance callers make long distance calls
And the silence makes me lonely
[Chorus]
I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
Guaranteed personality

[Bridge]
And it's not here
It disappeared

[Chorus]
I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
Guaranteed personality
I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
Guaranteed personality
I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
Guaranteed personality
I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
Guaranteed personality
I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer

I'm all lost

Clampdown Lyrics[Verse 1]
(The kingdom is ransacked
The jewels all taken back
And the chopper descends
They're hidden in the back
With a message on a half-baked tape
And the spool goes 'round
Sayin' I'm back here in this place
And I could cry
And there's smoke you could click on)

[Chorus]
A'what are we gonna do now?
Takin' off his turban, they said, "Is this man a Jew?"
Workin' for the clampdown
They put up a poster sayin' "We earn more than you!"
We're workin' for the clampdown
We will teach our twisted speech
To the young believers
We will train our blue-eyed men
To be young believers

[Post-Chorus]
The judge said "Five to ten" but I say "Double that again"
I'm not (workin' for the clampdown)
No man born with a livin' soul
Can be (workin' for the clampdown)
Kick over the wall, 'cause governments to fall
How can you refuse it?
Let fury have the hour, anger can be power
D'you know that you can use it?
[Verse 2]
The voices in your head are callin'
Stop wasting your time, there's nothing comin'
Only a fool would think someone could save you
The men at the factory are old and cunning
You don't owe nothin', so boy get running
It's the best years of your life they want to steal

[Chorus]
But, you grow up and you calm down
And you're (workin' for the clampdown)
You start wearin' blue and brown
And (workin' for the clampdown)
So you got someone to boss around
It makes ya' feel big now
You drift until you brutalize
Make your first kill now

[Post-Chorus]
In these days of evil presidentes
(Workin' for the clampdown)
But lately one or two has fully paid their dues
For (workin' for the clampdown)
Ha! Get along! Get along!
(Workin' for the clampdown)
Ha! Get along! Get along!
(Workin' for the clampdown)
[Bridge]
Yeah I’m workin' hard in Harrisburg
Workin' hard in Petersburg
(Workin' for the clampdown)
(Workin' for the clampdown)
Ha! Get along! Get along
Beggin' to be melted down
(Get along, get along)
Work

And I ain't giving away no secrets – ha!

Train in Vain Lyrics[Verse 1]
You say you stand by your man
So tell me something I don't understand
You said you love me and that's a fact
And then you left me, said you felt trapped
Well, some things you can explain away
But the heartache's in me 'til this day

[Chorus]
You didn't stand by me
No, not at all
You didn't stand by me
No way

[Verse 2]
All the times when we were close
I'll remember these things the most
I see all my dreams come tumblin' down
I can't be happy without you around
So alone I keep the wolves at bay
And there's only one thing I can say

[Chorus]
You didn't stand by me
No, not at all
You didn't stand by me
No way
[Bridge]
You must explain
Why this must be
Did you lie
When you spoke to me?
Did you stand by me?
No, not at all

[Verse 3]
Now I got a job, but it don't pay
I need new clothes, I need somewhere to stay
But without all of these things I can do
But without your love, I won't make it through
But you don't understand my point of view
I suppose there's nothing I can do

[Chorus]
You didn't stand by me
No, not at all
You didn't stand by me
No way

[Bridge]
You must explain
Why this must be
Did you lie
When you spoke to me?
Did you stand by me?
[Outro]
Did you stand by me?
No, not at all
Did you stand by me?
No way
Did you stand by me?
No, not at all
Did you stand by me?
