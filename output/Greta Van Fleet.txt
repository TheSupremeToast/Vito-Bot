Black Smoke Rising Lyrics[Verse 1]
I didn't know there was a tower
Where they look out to the land
To see the people quickly passing by
This is for their own desire
As they spit down to the earth
To feel the power boiling in their veins

[Pre-Chorus]
Woah oh oh oh oh, yeah, yeah
Woah oh oh oh oh, yeah, yeah!

[Chorus]
And the black smoke rises
From the fires, we've been told
It's the new age crisis
And we will stand up in the cold
Stand up in the cold

[Verse 2]
Many people are dividing
And a world apart with just one heart
Is bound to keel and fade away
None of us will be deciding
And the fate of man is in the hands
Of he who stands and heeds the call
[Pre-Chorus]
Woah oh oh oh oh, yeah, yeah
Woah oh oh oh oh, yeah, yeah!

[Chorus]
And the black smoke rises
From the fires, we've been told
It's the new age crisis
And we will stand up in the cold
Stand up in the cold

[Bridge]
Oh oh, woah-woah
Oh oh, woah-woah
(We won't stand alone, we will stand up in the cold)
(We won't stand alone, we will stand up in the cold)
Stand up in the cold
We won't stand, yeah!

[Chorus]
And the black smoke rises
From the fires, we've been told
It's the new age crisis
And we will stand up in the cold
And the black smoke rises
From the fires, we've been told
It's the new age crisis
And we will stand up in the cold
Stand up in the cold16Embed

She is a lady, comes from all around
She's many places, but she's homeward bound
And now she walks kinda funny

When the Curtain Falls Lyrics[Intro]
(One, two, three, four)

[Verse 1]
Well, you're so pretty and I love you so
You know I'm your biggest fan
I saw your picture and it's the best
The finest in the land

[Pre-Chorus]
Camera, lights, and action
Yeah, the words you know so well
You're in and out of fashion
In Hollywood of Hell

[Chorus]
When the curtain falls
Walk the hollow halls, babe
Once a valley doll
Now you're not at all, no

[Verse 2]
Well, I love you in that movie show
Can I have your autograph?
It's so funny you have such charm
The whole thing made me laugh
[Pre-Chorus]
Obetrol and cocktails
You're counting all your rings
They all said they loved you
Didn't they, darling?
Well, they've taken all your things

When the curtain falls
Walk the hollow halls, babe
Once a valley doll
Now you're not at all, no

[Bridge]
Well, listen, darling
It's been real swell
What can I say?
You've got it all
You're a one woman show
But I'm not gonna lie to you
You could use a little work
Well, at your age
Well

When the curtain falls
Walk the hollow halls, babe
Once a valley doll
Now you're not at all

Edge of Darkness Lyrics[Verse 1]
Every day's a new day
Every way's a new way
On the edge of darkness, finding out what it means to love
And to think we've found the time

[Chorus]
All my brothers we stand for the peace of the land
Is there meaning?
I've got love in my heart for an army apart
I am bleeding
All my brothers we stand for the peace of the land
Is there meaning?
I've got love in my heart for an army apart
I am bleeding

Always searching for light
What the world is made of when I'm thinking it's right?
And to think we've found the time

Heat Above Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sorrows of the Earth
May our tears of rain wash down to bathe you
This is what life is worth
When the fires still burn and rage all around

[Refrain]
Can you hear that dreadful sound?
Fire still burning on the ground

[Verse 2]
Follow the fearsome sound
As they march to battle, hear the drums pound
We do not fight for war
But to save the lives of those who do so

[Refrain]
Can you hear that dreadful sound?
Fire still burning on the ground

[Chorus]
Can you feel my love?
Rising with the heat above
Life's the story of
Ascending to the stars as one

Marching across the land
Is a peaceful army joining the band
Walking hand in hand
To an anthem loudly sung where they stand

[Refrain]
Can you hear that dreadful sound?
Fire still burning on the ground

Age of Man Lyrics[Intro]
In an age of darkness light appears
And it wards away the ancient fears
March to the anthem of the heart
To a brand new day, a brand new start

[Verse 1]
To wonderlands of ice and snow
In the desert heat where nothing grows
A tree of life in rain and sun
To reach the sky it's just begun

[Chorus]
And as we came into the clear
To find ourselves where we are here
Who is the wiser to help us steer?
And will we know when the end is near?

[Verse 2]
A beauty lives in every soul
The more you love the more you know
They pass the torch and it still burns
Once children then it's now our turn

[Chorus]
And as we came into the clear
To find ourselves where we are here
Who is the wiser to help us steer?
And will we know when the end is near?
And as we came into the clear
To find ourselves where we are here
Who is the wiser to help us steer?
And will we know when the end is near?10Embed

Always There Lyrics[Verse 1]
You've been waiting for your lover
When you'll discover
She's always there
Walk a while in her summer
She is the drummer
Of your beating heart
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Find another

One that makes you fall in love

Dream forever in your wonder
She'll never sunder

Talk on the Street LyricsOh mama you lie in ruin
Can't you see what you've done
Well I've been there before
What's this war that you won
Oh mama you walk this way
And I'm crying inside
Well I've been there before
And you know that it's time

And everybody's talking
But you never let them know
Yes I can hear them talking

Everyone knows
That's there's talking on the streets
Remember the days
When there's no one to defeat
Follow me down
To the mountain of the sun
Forgetting the end
As your new life has begun

Look mama the light is low
And the darkness near
Yes everyone is looking for me and you
And the night's what you fear
Look, someone, they follow us
And they're all undone
Yes everyone is looking for me and you
And the war has begun
And everybody's talking
But you never let em know
Yes I can hear them talking

Everyone knows
That's there's talking on the streets
Remember the days
When there's no one to defeat
Follow me down
To the mountain of the sun
Forgetting the end
As your new life has begun

And everybody's talking
And you never let them know
Yes I can hear them talking
And you never let them know7Embed
