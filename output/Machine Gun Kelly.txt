RAP DEVIL Lyrics[Intro]
Oh my God, Ronny

[Verse 1]
Ayy, somebody grab him some clippers (Zzzzt)
His fuckin' beard is weird
Tough talk from a rapper payin' millions for security a year
"I think my dad's gone crazy," yeah, Hailie, you right
Dad's always mad cooped up in the studio, yellin' at the mic
You're sober and bored, huh? (I know)
'Bout to be forty-six years old, dog
Talkin' 'bout "I'ma call up Trick Trick"
Man, you sound like a bitch, bitch
Man up and handle your shit (Ugh)
Mad about somethin' I said in 2012
Took you six years and a surprise album just to come with a diss (Huh)
Homie, we get it, we know that you're the greatest rapper alive
Fuckin' dweeb, all you do is read the dictionary and stay inside
Fuck "Rap God," I'm the Rap Devil
Comin' bare-faced with a black shovel
Like the Armageddon when the smoke settle
His body next to this instrumental, I'm sayin'

[Chorus]
I'm sick of them sweatsuits and them corny hats, let's talk about it
I'm sick of you bein' rich and you still mad, let's talk about it
Both of us single dads from the Midwest, we can talk about it
Or we could get gully, I'll size up your body and put some white chalk around it (Ayy)
[Verse 2]
Let's talk about the fact you actually blackballed a rapper
That's twice as young as you (Let's talk about it)
Let's call Sway
Ask why I can't go up to Shade 45 because of you (Brrt)
Let's ask Interscope
How you had Paul Rosenberg tryin' to shelf me (Huh?)
Still can't cover up the fact
Your last four albums is as bad as your selfie
Now tell me, what do you stand for? (What?)
I know you can't stand yourself (No)
Tryin' to be the old you so bad, you Stan yourself (Ha)
Let's leave all the beefin' to 50 (Please)
Em, you're pushin' fifty
Why you claimin' that I'ma call Puff
When you the one that called Diddy? (Facts)
Then you went and called Jimmy (Facts)
They conference called me in the morning (What?)
They told me you mad about a tweet
You wanted me to say sorry (What?)
I swear to God I ain't believe him (Nah)
Please say it ain't so (No)
The big bad bully of the rap game can't take a fuckin' joke
Oh, you want some fuckin' smoke (What?)
But not literally, you'll choke
Yeah, I'll acknowledge you're the G.O.A.T
But I'm The Gunner, bitch, I got you in the scope (Brrah)
Don't have a heart attack now (No)
Somebody help your mans up (Help)
Knees weak of old age, The Real Slim Shady can't stand up
[Chorus]
I'm sick of them sweatsuits and them corny hats, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
I'm sick of you bein' rich and you still mad, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
Both of us single dads from the Midwest, we can talk about it (Haha)
Or we could get gully, I'll size up your body and put some white chalk around it

[Verse 3]
Hello Marshall, my name's Colson
You should go back to Recovery (Wouh)
I know your ego is hurtin'
Just knowin' that all of your fans discovered me (Hi)
He like, "Damn, he a younger me
Except he dresses better and I'm ugly
Always making fun of me"
Stop all the thuggery, Marshall, you livin' in luxury (Ayy)
Look what you done to me
Dropped an album just because of me
Damn, you in love with me
You got money but I'm hungry
I like the diss but you won't say them lyrics out in front of me
Shout out to every rapper that's up under me
Know that I'll never do you like this fuckery
Still bitter after everyone loves you
Pull that wedgie out your dungarees (Ayy)
I gotta respect the OGs and I know most of 'em personally (Ayy)
But you're just a bully actin' like a baby
So I gotta read you a nursery (Pussy)
I'm the ghost of the future
And you're just Ebenezer Scrooge (Facts)
I said on Flex anyone could get it
I ain't know it would be you
[Chorus]
I'm sick of them sweatsuits and them corny hats, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
I'm sick of you bein' rich and you still mad, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
Both of us single dads from the Midwest, we can talk about it (Haha)
Or we could get gully, I'll size up your body and put some white chalk around it
[Bridge]
Ayy, ridin' shotty 'cause I gotta roll this dope
It's a fast road when your idols become your rivals, yeah
Never hesitate to say it to your face, I'm an asshole
Bitch-ass motherfucker
Oh my God, Ronny
Fuck Kells

[Verse 4]
We know you get nervous, Rabbit
I see Mama's spaghetti all over your sweater
I wish you would lose yourself on the records
That you made a decade ago, they were better
Accordin' to them, you're a national treasure
To me, you're as soft as a feather
The type to be scared to ask Rihanna for her number
Just hold her umbrella-ella-ella
"I'm not afraid," okay Oscar the Grouch, chill on the couch (Fuck)
You got an Oscar, damn
Can anyone else get some food in their mouth? (For real)
They made a movie about you, you're in everybody's top ten
You're not getting better with time
It's fine, Eminem, put down the pen
Or write an apology
Over the simple fact, you had to diss to acknowledge me
I am the prodigy
How could I even look up to you? You ain't as tall as me
5'8" and I'm 6'4", seven punches hold your head still
Last time you saw 8 Mile was at home on a treadmill
You were named after a candy
I was named after a gangster (Brr)
And don't be a sucker and take my verse off of Yelawolf's album, thank you (Thank you)
I just wanna feed my daughter
You tryna stop the money to support her
You the one always talkin' 'bout the action
Text me the addy, I'm pullin' up scrappin'
And I'm by my fuckin' self, what's happenin'
EST captain, salute me or shoot me
That's what he's gonna have to do to me
When he realizes there ain't shit he could do to me
Everybody always hated me, this isn't anything new to me
Yeah there's a difference between us
I got all of my shit without Dre producin' me (Ayy)
I know you're not used to me
Usually one of your disses should ruin me
But bitch I'm from Cleveland
Everybody quiet this evenin', I'm readin' the eulogy (Shh)
Dropped an album called Kamikaze
So that means he killed him
Already fucked one rapper's girl this week
Don't make me call Kim

[Chorus]
I'm sick of them sweatsuits and them corny hats, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
I'm sick of you bein' rich and you still mad, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
Both of us single dads from the Midwest, we can talk about it (Haha)
Or we could get gully, I'll size up your body and put some white chalk around it342Embed

DAYWALKER! Lyrics[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly & CORPSE]
Punch that motherfucker in the face
You hated what he said, right?
Beat his ass, leave him at the stoplight
I know you wanted change, but nobody's around
So, kick him again while he's on the ground, yo
I'll never be the same
I wanna know if I tell you a secret, will you keep it?
I need someone to blame (Take it!)
And I see somebody talkin' with a mouth that's full of teeth I wanna break (Go)

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: CORPSE]
They tried to kill me in the rain
Tried to lay me down and so I dodged and ran away
Put a gun up to my face, so I'll fucking catch a case (A case)
When I find this mothеrfucker, gonna lay him in his grave
All thesе fucking razorblades
I wanna know if I tell you a secret, will you keep it?
I won't ever be the same
I bit the fucking apple, I'm surrounded by some snakes (CORPSE)
[Chorus: CORPSE & Machine Gun Kelly]
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight (Yeah, yeah), fight

[Bridge: CORPSE]
Sdnah ydoolb
Bloody
Sdnah ydoolb

[Verse 3: Machine Gun Kelly, CORPSE & Both]
I prayed to God and then I went to sleep with bloody hands
Inside my room, I heard the sirens from the ambulance
I chipped my tooth and then I found a piece inside my pants
He talkin' shit, when he wake up, I go do that again
I came back
I wanna know if I tell you a secret, will you keep it?
If a pussy wanna say shit, then I'll fuckin' stomp his face in
Nah, not getting better, can't change it, I left blood all on the pavement
I'm on borrowed time, can't shake it, uh, blackout when I'm ragin', uh
Me and all these pills be on a fuckin' first name basis, uh
There's an invisible voice that is talkin' to me and it's always tellin' me to kill
I got a problem with separating what my head is creating from things that are real
I'm in a room, hyperventilating and debating to pop off the cap of these pills
If I get angry, I'm goin' to start up a riot like people on Capitol Hill
[Chorus: CORPSE & Machine Gun Kelly]
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight (Yeah, yeah), fight

​bloody valentine Lyrics[Verse 1]
Okay
The simulation just went bad
But you're the best I ever had
Like handprints in wet cement
She touched me, it's permanent

[Pre-Chorus]
In my head, in my head
I couldn't hear anything you said, but
In my head, in my head
I'm callin' you "girlfriend," what the fuck?

[Chorus]
I don't do fake love
But I'll take some from you tonight
I know I've got to go
But I might just miss the flight
I can't stay forever, let's play pretend
And treat this night like it'll happen again
You'll be my bloody valentine tonight

[Verse 2]
I'm overstimulated and I'm sad
I don't expect you to understand
It's nothing less than true romance
Or am I just makin' a mess?
[Pre-Chorus]
In my head, in my head
I'm lyin' naked with you, yeah
In my head, in my head
I'm ready to die holding your hand

[Chorus]
I don't do fake love
But I'll take some from you tonight (Take some from you tonight)
I know I've got to go
But I might just miss the flight
I can't stay forever, let's play pretend
And treat this night like it'll happen again
You'll be my bloody valentine tonight

[Bridge]
I can't hide
How I feel about you inside
I'd give everything up tonight
If I could just have you, be mine
Be mine, baby
I can't hide (I cannot hide these feelings, no)
How I feel about you inside (I cannot hide these feelings)
I'd give everything up tonight (I'd give up everything for you)
If I could just have you, be mine (I'd give up everything)
Be mine (Ayy)
[Chorus]
I don't do fake love
But I'll take some from you tonight (Take some from you tonight)
I know I've got to go
But I might just miss the flight
I can't stay forever, let's play pretend
And treat this night like it'll happen again
You'll be my bloody valentine tonight

No-no-no, no-no-no
No-no-no, not just tonight

No-no-no, not just tonight
No-no-no, no-no-no (In my head, in my head)

At My Best Lyrics[Intro: Machine Gun Kelly]
Turn my vocals up, alright

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
I wrote this song as a message for help
On behalf of anybody findin' their-self
I wrote this letter to numb your pain
'Cause everyday I wake up, I'm feelin' the same
I got issues just like you got issues
I've been hurt, I seen the scar tissue
If I showed you, would you run away?
Do I gotta hide 'em for you to wanna stay?
Do I, even need you? Should I leave you?
Do I, gotta be you, just to please you?
Do I, say I'm all good, when I bleed you
Through my heart? Quit tearin' mine apart

[Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
I shout, I swear, I get angry, I get scared
I fall, I break, I mess up, I make mistakes
But if you can't take me at my worst
You don't deserve me at my best

[Post-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
Gotta keep it goin', gotta keep my head up, uh
Gotta keep it goin', gotta keep my head up, uh
I gotta keep it goin', gotta keep my head up
'Cause life is about...
Aight check this out
[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Life is about makin' mistakes
It's also about trying to be great
Do not let failure scare you away
I know you fed up, you fall, get up
It's all in us, I can speak about it 'cause I did it (true)
Ladies and gentlemen, here's the exhibit
It's my life, look a little closer, you can see the highlight
Gold ain't always golden but I told 'em
Look at all the years I've been waitin' for a moment
Shed a lot of tears just to smile in the mornin'
Tell me could you love me? Tell me could you love me?
Tell me could you love me if I told you...

[Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
I shout, I swear, I get angry, I get scared
I fall, I break, I mess up, I make mistakes
But if you can't take me at my worst
You don't deserve me at my best

[Bridge: Machine Gun Kelly + Hailee Steinfeld]
This song's for anybody
Who feels like I did, never the cool kid
This song's for anybody
Who fought their way through, always remained true
This song's for anybody
The one's who trying to get it, the one's who dream it and live it
This song's for anybody
This song, this song, this song, this song, this song, this song
[Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
Ohh, I shout, I swear, I get angry, I get scared
I fall, I break, I mess up, I make mistakes
But if you can't take me at my worst
You don't deserve me at my best

[Post-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
Gotta keep it goin', gotta keep my head up, uh
Gotta keep it goin', gotta keep my head up, uh
I gotta keep it goin', gotta keep my head up

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Kells, I'm a east side Cleveland wild boy, east side Cleveland wild boy
We got baseball bats like the Indians, and my team pop off like Cowboys
You a "white-flag, throw-that-towel" boy, I'm a "jump-right-in-that-crowd" boy
You a "shhh, keep-it-down" boy, and I'm a "fuck-you, blow-that-loud" boy
All I know is how to kill every one of my cells
All they know is they can kill anybody but Kells
I am untouchable, you would think I was in jail
But I'm in Mexico getting marijuana from Miguel
Bring it back into the States, put it on a scale
Measure it at half a eighth, put it in a shell
Split it then I roll it, then light it up like it's Independence Day
I got a bottle rocket, put it in the air
Snapback with my city on it, text back with your titties on it
Levi's, put your kitty on it, start grindin' like the Clipse is on it
Drink it 'til I get pissy, biatch, smoke it 'til I get dizzy, biatch
Lose control like Missy, but I'm a Bad Boy 'cause I'm with Diddy, bitch!
[Refrain: Machine Gun Kelly]
There he go, that's John Doe (Oh)
There he go, that's John Doe (Oh)
Yeah, there he go, that's John Doe
Nevermind, that's just Kells with that heat
No LeBron though

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
Yeah, bitch, yeah, bitch, call me Steve-O
Yeah, bitch, yeah, bitch, call me Steve-O
I'm a wild boy, I'm a, I'm a wild boy

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Bricksquad! Uh oh, here come that bullshit
Beat a nigga ass 'til the DJ stop the music
They say they want that wild shit, mosh pit
Jump up in the crowd, bitch, I'm so mothafuckin' violent
Yeah, bitch, yeah, bitch, I'm with Steve-O
We bustin' bottles with bad bitches, blowin' weed smoke
Yeah, bitch, yeah, bitch, I'm with Steve-O
Royal Rumble in the club, John Ce-No
I'm screamin' "Riverdale" everywhere I go
I throw them bands ho, drop it low
Fuck 5-0, I make my own rules
Suck my dragon balls, bitch, call me Goku
(Yeah!) This liquor got the best of me
(Yeah!, No) This liquor got the best of me
Machine Gun Kelly, Flocka, that's the recipe
You gon' need King Kong if you step to me
[Bridge: Machine Gun Kelly]
Yeah, Cobain's back, yeah, Cobain's back
Got these crazy white boys yellin' "Cobain's back"
I call my weed Nirvana, smells like Teen Spirit
And my pack's so fuckin' loud you can't hear it!
Ah!

Yeah, bitch, yeah, bitch, call me Steve-O

Mind of a Stoner Lyrics[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Ok, I lost my job last night
Picked up my paycheck
But 35% of it's gone already cuz Uncle Sam ain't get paid yet
Mom and them bitchin bout this rent
I ain't even gon' say shit
And half of what is left goes to her
(why?) Cuz I ain't use that latex, damn
Cheese sandwich and chips (meal)
Slim just spilled his drink in my Toyota 96 (wheels)
Well at least that blunt is lit
Don't they say life is what you make it?
Then I’m tryna make it money
And ride through my hood clean as Easter Sunday, that’s wassup, uh

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
All my dreamer's put your hands in the sky
All my dreamer's put your hands in the sky
One time
All my dreamer's put your hands in the sky
All my dreamer's put your hands in the sky
One time
For the bullshit that you came from
Worked hard to get away from
But the devils there and you just can't seem to shake em
Two times
For them long nights that you stayed up
Thinkin about that paper
Crush it, lick it, split it, light it, blaze up
From the mind of a stoner, from the mind of a stoner
Simple thoughts from a loner, simple thoughts from a loner
Just the mind of a stoner, the mind of a stoner
Simpler thoughts from a loner, simple thoughts from a loner, oh
[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Parents aren't doin much now since little brother got locked up
And I’m stuck smokin this mid waiting for the weed man to get stocked up
And my girl cancelled on me, said something else popped up
And I can't get with my ex now cuz her ring finger all rocked up,damn
No one likes you when your 23 without a plan
Sit around in apartments all day smokin weed and I’m like
"bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe"
Till I (skkrrrrrrttt) out in my Subaru and in the rear view is them lights
I'm talking about red white and blue
The same color as our flag
The one's that they say salute
But the ones that's whoopin my ass
And the same days that I’m happy
Is the same days that I’m mad
Cuz I can't go 24 hours without shit happening to my ass, get high

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
All my dreamer's put your hands in the sky
All my dreamer's put your hands in the sky
One time
All my dreamer's put your hands in the sky
All my dreamer's put your hands in the sky
One time
For the bullshit that you came from
Worked hard to get away from
But the devils there and you just can't seem to shake em
Two times
For them long nights that you stayed up
Thinkin about that paper
Crush it, lick it, split it, light it, blaze up
From the mind of a stoner, from the mind of a stoner
Simple thoughts from a loner, simple thoughts from a loner
Just the mind of a stoner, the mind of a stoner
Simpler thoughts from a loner, simple thoughts from a loner, oh

Glass House Lyrics[Refrain: Naomi Wild]
All alone in a glass house
Lie awake 'til the sun's out
Pink sky when you come down
M3 in the driveway
Caffeine for the heartache
Never wanna have it my way

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Yeah, I fuck up and lose control
Burned so many bridges, got nowhere to go
Bitches got these motives like Anna Nicole
I'm smoking cigarettes alone until it burn a hole
In my lungs, in my soul, in my denim coat
Same place I'ma keep that knife if I'ma slit my throat
This shit ugly, I was just with Nipsey, now he ghost
They even got my homie Pete out here, like, fuck the jokes
Damn

[Refrain: Naomi Wild & Machine Gun Kelly]
Alone in a glass house (Just keep it going)
Lie awake 'til the sun's out
Pink sky when you come down
Sometimes I wanna fucking scream or run away, I don't know

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Ayy, life's been hard since 17
I've been through hell, I think I'm somewhere in between
Caught in purgatory, I can paint the scene
Everything turned to a nightmare from a dream
Look, wish Lil Peep and me had spoke, but I can't get that back
Just came from Pittsburgh, damn, I miss my homie Mac
Yeah, last time I got off the stage, I looked Chester in the face
But now he gone, and ain't no going back, uh
[Chorus: Naomi Wild & Machine Gun Kelly, Naomi Wild, Machine Gun Kelly]
Why don't you throw me in the damn flame?
Bury me in gold chains
Throw me in the damn flame
I'm waiting on the rain to come and wash it all away
Why don't you throw me in the damn flame?
Bury me in gold chains
Throw me in the damn flame

[Verse 3: Machine Gun Kelly]
Lately I've been sick of living and nobody knows how I'm really feeling
I always hated to smile, but it keep what is killing me hidden inside
I didn't sign up to be the hero, but I don't want to wind up a villain
I put my daughter to bed, then attempted to kill myself in the kitchen
Yeah, I should've screamed, but nobody listened
So I passed out with the blood drippin'
In this glass house, feeling like a prison
Me and death keep tongue-kissin'
I just fell out with my lil' bro, the life getting to us
The drink getting to us, the drugs getting to us
This highway to hell and everybody knew it
The fuck are we doing? I'm feeling like

[Chorus: Naomi Wild & Machine Gun Kelly, Naomi Wild, Machine Gun Kelly]
Why don't you throw me in the damn flame?
Bury me in gold chains
Throw me in the damn flame
I'm waiting on the rain to come and wash it all away
Why don't you throw me in the damn flame?
Bury me in gold chains
Throw me in the damn flame

Alpha Omega Lyrics[Intro]
We not asking mothafuckers to care about us
We just letting mothafuckas know we coming
It's real, it's a real mothafuckin' movement
Whether you like it or not
Whether you support it or not
It's a real mothafuckin' movement, man
It's Cleveland man

[Verse 1]
I am the alpha omega, black flag swinger
Fuck a driveway I’m in airplane hangers
Me and my gang poppin' champagne like players
For all of them days with no lights and no cable
No one can save you, my city’s fatal
Make it up out of it how can they hate you?
C-L-E-V-E-L-A-N-D’s the greatEST
I'll light this bitch up make it look like its Vegas
We on, mufucka we on
The first one to blow since Bone
Thinking back when I had a back pack full of fat raps
Didn’t no one wanna hear my song
Mufucka y’all wrong, mufucka y’all wrong
Made it and I never left home
Where I’m from enemies bust off their shells like King Koopa
Roll through these streets come up gone like Bermuda
I’m just a boy in the hood like I’m Cuba
So soon as I moved out I bought me a Ruger
You come to my house you blow loud as a tuba
I bring your bitch here, she'll go down like a scuba
All of y’all shits out of style like a scooter
Put all of y’all shits in the ditch like a sewer 
Make all of y’all bow like my name is Anubis
Talk out your medulla get hit with bazookas
[Hook]
(Bitch!)
I am the alpha, I am the omega
(What?)
I am the alpha, I am the omega
(Ahh!)
I am the alpha, I am the omega
(Ay!)
I am the alpha, I am the omega

[Verse 2]
If you ain’t living your life then you’re dead
And sleep is its cousin so I shot my bed
Paranoia got me using these meds
Now I'm Smokey as Chris on a Friday like Craig
Retract that statement, I'm stoney as Fred
Evacuate when my homies get mad
You better pray to your God for a blessing
Before they make your world look like Armageddon
Knew I was trouble since I was 11
Ripped up my jeans and I bought me a leather
My friends saw me as a King like Coretta
My dad saw his son as a nuisance, a rebel, and (ahh!)
My music sounds like the devil
Turn that shit off or get out of my temple
Right after that he’d go back to his Kettle One vodka
And drink it all up till he's mental
I have no issue, I am official
Let them come at me I practice Jiu Jitsu
Only fear two things with three letters dawg
That's G-O-D, God and my fucking initials
Doctors called up to the news to report to them what they discovered
Said I’m the first of a species that they call a real muthafucka, (Kells)
And I’m sorry if you get a lot of hits from all my followers
If you acknowledge us in any other way then positive
But you shouldn’t be hollering or talking about Superman
When you're living in Metropolis
And if you follow astronomy I’m a Taurus
That means I don’t give a fuck what you thought of me
I walk into an interview looking like a lobotomy
Flipping my middle finger at everybody who watching us, (uh)
Fuck that bring the beat back
Kill this instrumental leave the body where the reef at
Nah, fuck that where the keef at
Sprinkle a little bit on a quarter of my weed sack
Give me a minute I took a hit I'm tryna focus like astigmatism
My competition on my dick, they're like the zip on my denim
They want the heat I light em up like I put cigarettes in 'em
You bitch, whats your religion?
I wanna know what God you’re seeing in a couple of seconds
I wanna see the criticism bout my lyricism
When I’m in your face rippin' this rhythm up like canabalism
Its Kells
[Hook]
(Bitch!)
I am the alpha, I am the omega
(What?)
I am the alpha, I am the omega
(Ahh!)
I am the alpha, I am the omega
(Ay!)
I am the alpha, I am the omega

[Outro]
I am the alpha omega, the fuck is you saying?
I am the alpha omega, the fuck is you saying?
I am the alpha omega, the fuck is you saying?
EST run shit you better quit playing
They start a war if you mention my name
I’m the alpha omega

The Break Up Lyrics[Verse 1]
Girl I know
I know you bought me the watch
You ain't get it back though
My name's on the back though
I flipped the lock to the back door
And took the key under the mat though
I know you hate that
But you did some things that you cannot take back
I needed change
Left a nickel for a dime
That is a payback
"What you sayin?"
Bitch I'm over you and I ain't playing
Should've been a one night stand
But here we go again....

[Chorus]
I wish that I loved you
Or that I cared
Or that I'd even give a damn if you were here
But you're gone so it's fuck you
I'm a player
I am everything that you wanted but you're scared
I wish that I loved you
Or that I cared
Or that I'd even give a damn if you were here
But you're gone so it's fuck you
I'm a player
I am everything that you wanted but you're scared
[Verse 2]
Please never call me
Do not mention me in any stories
Do not show up at the homie's party
Come up to me and then say I'm sorry
You're just a
You just a — hold up let me stop
The Henny shots got the petty talk comin I don't wanna have them thoughts running
Can't believe that I bust in a thot's stomach
Fuck is wrong with you
I don't even get along with you
(Not even a little bit) 
But the head was phenomenal, 
Used to do that in the car with you
(True)
Used to travel around the world just for the rendezvous
(Come through) 
Now I gotta get high just to deal with you these are the chronicles

[Chorus]
I wish that I loved you
Or that I cared
Or that I'd even give a damn if you were here
But you're gone so it's fuck you
I'm a player
I am everything that you wanted but you're scared
I wish that I loved you
Or that I cared
Or that I'd even give a damn if you were here
But you're gone so it's fuck you
I'm a player
I am everything that you wanted but you're scared

I wish that I loved you
Or that I cared
Or that I'd even give a damn if you were here
But you're gone so it's fuck you
I'm a player
I am everything that you wanted but you're scared

I wish that I loved you
Or that I cared
Or that I'd even give a damn if you were here
But you're gone so it's fuck you
I'm a player
I am everything that you wanted
Everything that you wanted25Embed

Breaking News Lyrics(Intro talking - Interview Sound Clip of Diddy)
No mercy has begun
Ladies and gentlemen
Machine Gun Kelly
This kid, I think he is a star
He's one of the best live performers I've ever seen
He's also more importantly a movement

[Verse 1]
Backpack? Fuck that
I was always hanging where the thugs at
I was always hanging with the rugrats
Someone come and show me where the drugs at
Someone come and pop on a hot song, meaning my shit, get an iPhone take a video and make it last long get some popcorn because I murder every single instrumental that I get on
And a muthafucka isn't gonna stop the shit
Until I make an album like a 2pacalypse
Until I'm killing everybody like in Auschwitz
Until I'm revolutionary like a Gandhi is
Until I'm poppin' all these bottles to accomplishments
Until I'm always hot no matter what the climate is
Until whenever somebody is feeling talkative my name is brought up, doesn't matter what the topic is
Didn't think I rap? Bitch I flow like "boom boom bap"
Bitch I come from where you never moved at
Look into my room get a view, look at my past
God damn
Got weed, got jack, oxy's? Had that
Got Jimi, got Slash, got shrooms, got hash
Bipolar syndrome, kicked in, got mad
Walked on the red carpet like kiss my ass you bitch
(More Sound Clips of Various People talking about MGK)
He was truly the only developed on-point performer on the bill
If you know anything about lyricists, then you know who MGK is
I need a freestyle, I need to hear Machine Gun Kelly spit

[Verse 2]
Fuck that, y'all don't gotta hear shit
Ask anybody in the 216 if my name rings bells in them bricks
"Man everybody know who that is"
What you hate, boy? You late, boy
You ain't heard about that great boy?
3 letter name cacausian boy
Used to live right there up the way, boy
You heard about him, you've said the name
You saw the iTunes and clicked to play
You liked the shit and you bought the shit
Put him on the playlist right next to Jay
Then your girl saw me, I signed her tits
And she disappeared you couldn't find the bitch
Then your heart stopped you know what time it is
I put my dick in her common sense
Fuck boy you lonely
Fuck boy you phony
You would think these fuck boys fucking boys with the way that they be all on me
If it ain't EST in your mouth...then whatever you rep is corny
Got a new single without me on it? That shit's boring, bitch I'm snoring
Man I'm touring every damn day
I showed y'all how to turn up
100 j's in my ashtray bitch I showed y'all how to burn up
I sacrificed what y'all wouldn't give to these kids and now you love fans?
None of these rappers got a movement tell 'em quit jocking my ass
God damn...
And y'all can have the bloggers I don't type shit
God gave me both these hands to fight with
Wassup!?
Now say goodnight quick because my right fist's like Vicodin
Might just throw you on the ground like dices
Might just go into the pocket with your license, get a wallet and a couple dollars, buy nice shit
Dyke bitches all over my dick, that's priceless
I just fuck 'em if they're wet like Pisces
Wives is jealous of the bitch I'm with cause they almost F'd like D-...get it?
Digest every little word I'm spittin' cause it's food for thought so pay attention
Better listen, I’m on a mission to killing off all of my competition and if you are with that then good riddance muthafucka!
(Outro Talking - More Various Interview Sound Clips)
Now Machine Gun Kelly seems like somebody you would diss, lyrically I wouldn't think you'd like Machine Gun Kelly
What are you trying to say, he's wack or something?
He is wack
He's not wack
He's better than 80% of the rappers out there
It must be nice being MGK right now
The rapper recently released what he says to be the true meaning of his Lace Up movement
If there was ever a musical speaker that I could put out there for my personality, Machine Gun Kelly was it65Embed
