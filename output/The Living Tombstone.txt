It’s Been So Long Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don’t know what I was thinking
Leaving my child behind
Now I suffer the curse and now I am blind
With all this anger, guilt, and sadness
Coming to haunt me forever
I can't wait for the cliff at the end of the river

[Pre-Chorus]
Is this revenge I am seeking?
Or seeking someone to avenge me?
Stuck in my own paradox, I wanna set myself free
Maybe I should chase and find
Before they'll try to stop it
It won't be long before I'll become a puppet

[Chorus]
It's been so long
Since I last have seen my son
Lost to this monster
To the man behind the slaughter
Since you've been gone
I've been singing this stupid song
So I could ponder
The sanity of your mother
[Verse 2]
I wish I lived in the present
With the gift of my past mistakes
But the future keeps luring in like a pack of snakes
Your sweet little eyes, your little smile is all I remember
Those fuzzy memories mess with my temper

[Pre-Chorus]
Justification is killing me, but killing isn't justified
What happened to my son? I'm terrified
It lingers in my mind and the thought keeps on getting bigger
I'm sorry, my sweet baby, I wish I'd been there

[Chorus]
It's been so long
Since I last have seen my son
Lost to this monster
To the man behind the slaughter
Since you've been gone
I've been singing this stupid song
So I could ponder
The sanity of your mother108Embed

No Mercy Lyrics[Verse 1: BlackGryph0n]
This is the worst team I have ever played with in my life
When we finally get on the point, everyone dies
I understand that every now and then a team won't click
When it comes to you, I don't think I can sympathize

[Chorus: BlackGryph0n]
You should've picked Mercy
You should've picked any kind of support
We ended up losing, and it's all your fault
You should learn how this game works
You should've been helping—

[Interruption: LittleJayneyCakes]
If you like Mercy so much, why don't you just marry her?

[Verse 2: LittleJayneyCakes]
So you're the type that gets on mic and tries to lecture me
You're the most useless person we have on our team
I've never seen anybody rage quite as hard as you
Maybe you should go back to playing Team Fortress 2

[Chorus: LittleJayneyCakes & BlackGryph0n]
I'm not gonna be Mercy
I'm not gonna be any kind of support
We ended up losing, and you got all mad
Your tears are what I live for
You should've been Mercy
I'm not gonna be any kind of support
We ended up losing, and it's all your fault
Your tears are what I live for
[Bridge: LittleJayneyCakes & BlackGryph0n]
Maybe I'll be Tracer
I'm already Tracer
What about Widowmaker?
I'm already Widowmaker
I'll be Bastion
Nerf Bastion
You're right. So, Winston
I wanna be Winston
I guess I'll be Genji
I'm already Genji
Then I'll be McCree
I already chose McCree
I have an idea
What's your idea?
You should be...
I'm not gonna be Mercy

[Chorus: LittleJayneyCakes & BlackGryph0n]
You should've picked Mercy
I'm not gonna be any kind of support
We ended up losing, and it's all your fault
Your tears are what I live for
I'm not gonna be Mercy
You should've picked any kind of support
We ended up losing, and you got all mad
You should learn how this game works23Embed

My Ordinary Life Lyrics[Intro (Japanese)]
Jā, iku zo
Jan, ken, pon!

[Verse 1]
They tell me keep it simple, I tell them take it slow
I feed and water an idea so I let it grow
I tell them take it easy, they laugh and tell me "no"
It's cool, but I don't see them laughin' at my money though
They spittin' facts at me, I’m spittin' tracks, catch me?
I'm spinning gold out my records, know you can’t combat me
They tell me Jesus walks, I tell them money talks
Bling got me chill, 'cause I'm living in an ice box
They tell me I've been sleepin', I say I'm wide awake
Tracks hot and ready, so they call me Mister Easy-Bake
They say the grass is greener, I think my grass is dank
Drivin' with a drank on an empty tank to the bank

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you feel me? Take a look inside my brain
The people always different but it always feels the same
That's the real me, pop the champagne
The haters wanna hurt me, and I'm laughin' at the pain

[Chorus]
Stayin' still, eyes closed
Let the world just pass me by
Pain pills, nice clothes
If I fall, I think I'll fly
Touch me, Midas
Make me part of your design
None to guide us
I feel fear for the very last time
[Verse 2]
They tell me that I'm special, I smile and shake my head
I'll give them stories to tell friends about the things I said
They tell me I’m so humble, I say I'm turning red
They let me lie to them and don’t feel like they've been misled
They give so much to me, I'm losing touch, get me?
Served on a silver platter, ask for seconds, they just let me
They tell me I'm a God, I'm lost in the facade
Six feet off the ground at all times, I think I'm feelin' odd
No matter what I make, they never see mistakes
Makin' so much bread, I don't care that they're just being fake
They tell me they're below me, I act like I'm above
The people blend together, but I would be lost without their love

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Can you heal me? Have I gained too much?
When you become untouchable, you're unable to touch
Is there a real me? Pop the champagne
It hurts me just to think, and I don't do pain

[Chorus]
Stayin' still, eyes closed
Let the world just pass me by
Pain pills, nice clothes
If I fall I think I'll fly
Touch me, Midas
Make me part of your design
None to guide us
I feel fear for the very last time
[Outro]
Lay still, restless
Losing sleep while I lose my mind (Yeah)
All thrill, no stress
All my muses left behind (Left behind)
World is, below
So high up, I'm near divine (I'm so high up)
Lean in, let go
I feel fear for the very last time30Embed

Five Nights at Freddy’s Lyrics[Verse 1]
We're waiting every night
To finally roam and invite
Newcomers to play with us
For many years, we've been all alone
We're forced to be still and play
The same songs we've known since that day
An impostor took our life away
Now, we're stuck here to decay

[Pre-Chorus]
Please let us get in
Don't lock us away
We're not like what you're thinking
We're poor little souls
Who have lost all control
And we're forced here to take that role!
We've been all alone
Stuck in our little zone since 1987
Join us, be our friend or just be stuck and defend
After all, you only got

[Chorus]
Five Nights at Freddy's
Is this where you wanna be?
I just don't get it
Why do you wanna stay?
Five Nights at Freddy's
Is this where you wanna be?
I just don't get it
Why do you want to stay?
Five Nights at Freddy's
[Verse 2]
We're really quite surprised
We get to see you another night
You should have looked for another job
You should have said to this place goodbye
It's like there's so much more
Maybe you've been in this place before
We remember a face like yours
You seem acquainted with those doors

[Pre-Chorus]
Please let us get in
Don't lock us away
We're not like what you're thinking
We're poor little souls
Who have lost all control
And we're forced here to take that role!
We've been all alone
Stuck in our little zone since 1987
Join us, be our friend or just be stuck and defend
After all, you only got

Five Nights at Freddy's
Is this where you wanna be?
I just don't get it
Why do you want to stay?

Discord Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm not a fan of puppeteers, but I've a nagging fear
Someone else is pulling at the strings
Something terrible is going down through the entire town
Wreaking anarchy and all it brings

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't sit idly, no, I can't move at all
I curse the name, the one behind it all

[Chorus]
Discord, I'm howlin' at the moon
And sleeping in the middle of a summer afternoon
Discord, whatever did we do
To make you take our world away?
Discord, are we your prey alone
Or are we just a stepping stone for taking back the throne?
Discord, we won't take it anymore
So take your tyranny away

[Post-Chorus]
Discord!
Discord!

[Verse 2]
I'm fine with changing status quo, but not in letting go
Now the world is being torn apart
A terrible catastrophe played by your symphony
What a terrifying work of art
[Pre-Chorus]
I can't sit idly, no, I can't move at all
I curse the name, the one behind it all

[Chorus]
Discord, I'm howlin' at the moon
And sleeping in the middle of a summer afternoon
Discord, whatever did we do
To make you take our world away?
Discord, are we your prey alone
Or are we just a stepping stone for taking back the throne?
Discord, we won't take it anymore

Discord, we won't take it anymore

I Got No Time Lyrics[Verse 1]
I got no time, I got no time to live
I got no time to live and I can't say goodbye
And I'm regretting having memories
Of my friends, who they used to be
Beside me before they left me to die
And I know this is, I know this is the truth
'Cause I've been staring at my death so many times
These scary monsters roaming in the halls
I wish I could just block the doors
And stay in bed until the clock will chime

[Chorus]
So my flashlight's on, and stay up 'til dawn
I got this headache and my life's on the line
I felt like I won but I wasn't done
The nightmare repeats itself every time
Got to keep my calm and carry on
Stay awake until the sun will shine
But I'm not so strong and they're not gone
They're still out there to take what's left of mine

[Verse 2]
I have this urge, I have this urge to kill
I have this urge to kill and show that I'm alive
I'm getting sick from these apologies
From people with priorities
That their life matters so much more than mine
But I'm stuttering, I'm stuttering again
No one will listen and no one will understand
Because I'm crying as much as I speak
'Cause no one likes me when I shriek
Want to go back to when it all began
[Chorus]
So my flashlight's on, and stay up 'til dawn
I got this headache and my life's on the line
I felt like I won but I wasn't done
The nightmare repeats itself every time
Got to keep my calm and carry on
Stay awake until the sun will shine
But I'm not so strong and they're not gone
They're still out there to take what's left of mine27Embed

Die in a Fire Lyrics[Verse 1]
I really hate you, stop getting in my way
I've lost my patience, when are you gonna decay?
I want to throw you out just like my broken TV
If you'll come back once more it shall be painful, you'll see

[Chorus]
I hope you die in a fire
Hope you'll be stabbed in the heart
Hope you'll get shot and expire
Hope you'll be taken apart
Hope this is what you desire

[Verse 2]
It's almost over, why can't you just let it fly?
Don't be afraid, it's not the first time you'll die
Your mechanical parts click, sounds like when I broke your bones
Once I get my second chance, I won't leave you alone, oh yeah

[Chorus]
I hope you die in a fire
Hope you'll be stabbed in the heart
Hope you'll get shot and expire
Hope you'll be taken apart
I hope you die in a fire
Hope you'll be stabbed in the heart
Hope you'll get shot and expire
Hope you'll be taken apart
Hope this is what you desire

September Lyrics[Verse 1: The Living Tombstone]
I can't remember
What happened in September
When everything is gone
When it's dark and I'm alone
It's been forever
Since I could have remembered
Where the hell is everypony?
I just want to know the story
Of what happened right before
I became so alone

[Verse 2: The Living Tombstone]
Still can't remember
What happened in September
Back when everypony died
Trails of blood during my stride
I just discovered
That the ponies were defeated
By something really strong
It seemed very weird and wrong
It just doesn't belong
Like it came out of this world

[Spoken: Mic the Microphone & The Living Tombstone]
Finally
Finally, It's done, hahaha
It's finally done, hahaha
Stop it
He's trying to kill us all, stop him!
No, no
I'm going to save you
I'm going to save you all
Don't you try to stop me
[Bridge: The Living Tombstone]
I've regained a small memory
Came to my head just like that suddenly
I think I've gotten a clue
Something tells me this is worse than what I knew

[Spoken: Mic the Microphone]
This is your redemption day, everypony
Go away from me!
Stay away from me!
Go away!
You can't touch me now!
You see this button here?
I'm going to press it

[Outro: The Living Tombstone]
I just remembered
What happened in September
I'm the one who killed them all
I survived after the fall14Embed

I Can’t Fix You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've been trying for so long to sing you the right song
To show you something different every day
So you hear what I have to say like puzzle pieces
And now, we're here at a standstill
I wonder if you feel the kind of pain that rips your insides out
That's something I know all about
Shocking, ain't it?

[Chorus]
Is it because I can't be her?
Made your mistakes and make me hurt
I can't fix you
Is it because I can't be her?
Made me awake and make me hurt
I can't fix you (I can't fix you)

[Verse 2]
I can feel my heart breaking, mistakes I've been making
I'm running out of patience to pretend
This isn't how I'll let it end, my feigning fading
You've been mourning your loss here
And that's grinding my gears
How can a human lose their self-control?
There's nothing left to make you whole
I'm done explaining
[Chorus]
Is it because I can't be her?
Made your mistakes and make me hurt
I can't fix you
Is it because I can't be her?
Made me awake and make me hurt
I can't fix you

[Bridge]
This is what happens when you
Leave it to somebody else
If you want it done right
You should just do it yourself
You oversaturate your world
With nothing but machines
You might make everyone happy
But you're dead inside, just like me

[Verse 3]
And now we're here at a standstill
I wonder if you feel the kind of pain that rips your insides out?
That's something I know all about
Shocking, ain't it?
We have a lot more in common than you would be calm with
It's like we're the same person, me and you
We both don't know we can do
[Chorus]
Is it because I can't be her?
Made your mistakes and make me hurt
I can't fix you
Is it because I can't be her?
Made me awake and make me hurt
I can't fix you
Is it because I can't be her?
Made your mistakes and make me hurt
I can't fix you
Is it because I can't be her?
Made me awake and make me hurt
I can't fix you26Embed

Alastor’s Game Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've got a game I wanna show you
If I tell you my name, you'll have to play too
I've been here for years, biding my time
Waiting and primed until I could find you
Just sign on a line and we can be friends
I'll be here for you until your world ends
Enjoy all your toys, I will supply
You only live once and you'll be mine

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The day you die, I'll have my payment
Your eternal soul's enslavement
Did you divine our dark arrangement?
You were lovely entertainment
The dark desires you've been serving
You can bet that you're deserving
No regret for who you're hurting
Why, it's almost like you're flirting

[Chorus]
Come into my world, take a look at me
I am the nightmare on the dark side of the moon
I'm your first last resort, so call me when you need a helping hand
Play your cards wrong and I'll see you soon
[Verse 2]
Sorry, I don't mean to alarm you
If you ask me to stay, I would be charmed to
You all have such cozy little lives
How do you survive like that? I wish I knew
But you've got a lovely little secret
You're tired of feeling awful small
So you give Mr. Alastor a call to make a deal

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Because you're hungry for the sights
You wanna see them, earthly delights
You feel you need them, your appetites
I'll help you feed them, I'll be your sweet radio demon
And once your hunger has abated
Don't forget your friend who waited
Watched as you endulged your thirst and
Did I mention that you're cursed?

[Chorus]
Come into my world, take a look at me
I am the nightmare on the dark side of the moon
I'm your first last resort, so call me when you need a helping hand
Play your cards wrong and I'll see you soon
You lay your chips out on the table now
When you gamble souls, the house will always win
I'm double-dealing in betrayal and I'm here to cash my payout
I hope it was worth the life of sin
Welcome to my world, take a look around
Inside your nightmare, deep beyond the mortal veil
You made a wrong turn at the crossroads
Now you're at the final episode, eternity with me in Hell
[Outro]
Pleasure to play, how I enjoyed you
Suffice to say when I play, I don't lose
Collect on the debts that you accrued
It was such a gas, I really am amused
Have a dark thought, I'm right beside you
A casual whisper just to guide you
Look over your shoulder and I'm gone
Remember this song and I bid you adieu22Embed
