Sign of the Times Lyrics[Verse 1]
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
Welcome to the final show
Hope you're wearing your best clothes
You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky
You look pretty good down here
But you ain't really good

[Pre-Chorus]
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
Your bullets? Your bullets?

[Chorus]
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here

[Verse 2]
Just stop your crying, have the time of your life
Breaking through the atmosphere
And things are pretty good from here
Remember everything will be alright
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here
[Pre-Chorus]
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?

[Chorus]
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Stop your crying, baby, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here

[Pre-Chorus]
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? Your bullets?

[Bridge]
We don't talk enough, we should open up
Before it's all too much
Will we ever learn? We've been here before
It's just what we know
[Outro]
Stop your crying, baby, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away, we got to get away
We got to get away, we got to get away
We got to get away
We got to, we got to, away
We got to, we got to, away
We got to, we got to, away347Embed

Falling Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm in my bed
And you're not here
And there's no one to blame but the drink in my wandering hands
Forget what I said
It's not what I meant
And I can't take it back, I can't unpack the baggage you left

[Chorus]
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'

[Verse 2]
You said you cared, and you missed me too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you
And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say

[Chorus]
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
[Bridge]
And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again

[Chorus]
What am I now? What am I now?
What if you're someone I just want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'129Embed

Medicine LyricsLyrics from live performances

[Verse 1]
I’m here to take my medicine, take my medicine
Treat you like a gentleman
Give me that adrenaline, that adrenaline
Think I'm gonna stick with you
Here to take my medicine, take my medicine
Rest it on your fingertips
Up to your mouth, I’m feeling it out
I’m feeling it out

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a few, got drunk on you, and now I'm wasted
And when I sleep I'm gonna dream of how you tasted

[Chorus]
If you go out tonight, I'm going out 'cause I know you're persuasive
You got that salt, I got me an appetite, and now I can taste it
You get me dizzy, oh, you get me dizzy, oh
La la la la la
We're getting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh

[Verse 2]
Tingle running through my bones, fingers to my toes
Tingle running through my bones
The boys and the girls are here
I mess around with them
And I'm okay with it
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm coming down, I figured out I kinda like it
And when I sleep, I'm gonna dream of how you ride it

[Chorus]
If you go out tonight, I'm going out 'cause I know you're persuasive
You got that salt, I got me an appetite, and now I can taste it
You get me dizzy, oh, you get me dizzy, oh

We're getting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh

Fine Line Lyrics[Verse 1]
Put a price on emotion
I'm looking for something to buy
You've got my devotion
But man, I can hate you sometimes
I don't want to fight you
And I don't want to sleep in the dirt
We'll get the drinks in
So I'll get to thinking of her

[Chorus]
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line

[Verse 2]
Test of my patience
There's things that we'll never know
You sunshine, you temptress
My hand's at risk, I fold
Crisp trepidation
I'll try to shake this soon
Spreading you open
Is the only way of knowing you
[Chorus]
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line

Cherry Lyrics[Intro: Camille Rowe]
Coucou

[Chorus]
Don't you call him "baby"
We're not talking lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me

[Verse 1]
I, I confess I can tell that you are at your best
I'm selfish so I'm hating it
I noticed that there's a piece of you in how I dress
Take it as a compliment

[Chorus]
Don't you call him "baby"
We're not talking lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me

[Verse 2]
I, I just miss
I just miss your accent and your friends
Did you know I still talk to them?

[Bridge]
Does he take you walking 'round his parents' gallery?
[Chorus]
Don't you call him "baby"
We're not talking lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me
Don't you call him "baby" (Coucou)
We're not talking lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me (Coucou)

I'm sorry by the way
Never coming back down
Can't you see?

Kiwi Lyrics[Verse 1]
She worked her way through a cheap pack of cigarettes
Hard liquor mixed with a bit of intellect
And all the boys, they were saying they were into it
Such a pretty face
On a pretty neck

[Pre-Chorus]
She's driving me crazy, but I'm into it
But I'm into it, I'm kinda into it
It's getting crazy, I think I'm losing it
I think I'm losing it, oh, I think she said

[Chorus]
"I'm having your baby"
"It's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby"
"It's none of your business" (It's none of your, it's none of your—)
"I'm having your baby" (Hey, ah)
"It's none of your business" (Oh)
"I'm having your baby" (Hey, hey)
"It's none of your, it's none of your—" (Ow!)

[Verse 2]
It's New York, baby, always jacked up (Hey)
Holland Tunnel for a nose, it's always backed up
When she's alone, she goes home to a cactus (Uh)
In a black dress
She's such an actress
[Pre-Chorus]
Driving me crazy, but I'm into it
But I'm into it, I'm kinda into it
It's getting crazy, I think I'm losing it
I think I'm losing it, oh, I think she said

[Chorus]
"I'm having your baby" (Hey)
"It's none of your business" (Oh)
"I'm having your baby" (Hey)
"It's none of your business" (It's none of your, it's none of your—)

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Ah, la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 3]
She sits beside me like a silhouette
Hard candy dripping on me 'til my feet are wet
And now she's all over me, it's like I paid for it (Cha-ching!)
It's like I paid for it
I'm gonna pay for this
[Chorus]
It's none of your, it's none of your—
"I'm having your baby" (Hey)
"It's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby" (Hey)
"It's none of your business" (It's none of your, none of your—)

Golden Lyrics[Intro]
Hey!

[Verse 1]
Golden, golden, golden as I open my eyes
Hold it, focus, hoping, take me back to the light
I know you were way too bright for me
I'm hopeless, broken, so you wait for me in the sky
Brown my skin just right
You're so golden

[Chorus]
You're so golden
I'm out of my head, and I know that you're scared
Because hearts get broken

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone when it ends
Don't wanna let you know
I don't wanna be alone
But I can feel it take a hold (I can feel it take a hold)
I can feel you take control (I can feel you take control)
Of who I am, and all I've ever known
Lovin' you's the antidote
Golden
[Chorus]
You're so golden
I don't wanna be alone
You're so golden
You're so golden
I'm out of my head, and I know that you're scared
Because hearts get broken

I know that you're scared because I'm so open

I don't wanna be alone
You're so golden
You're so golden
You're so golden
I'm out of my head, and I know that you're scared
Because hearts get broken101Embed
