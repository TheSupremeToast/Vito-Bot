Just My Type Lyrics[Verse 1: Bradley Simpson]
M-m-m-m-m-my... more than meets the eye
To tell the truth would be a lie
I saw her out on Friday night, misunderstood
She's falling for a guy
That cigarette, it needs a light
Pluck up the courage and invite her nowhere good

[Pre-Chorus: Bradley Simpson]
'Cause I need this more than just a one night stand
Need that honey when she hold my hand
Times like this they call for true romance
But she's not ready for that

[Chorus: Bradley Simpson]
She lets me down
Then gets me high
Oh I don't know why she's just my type
She's bad advice
I don't think twice
Oh I don't know why she's what I like

[Post-Chorus: Bradley Simpson]
But I, I, I love it
I, I, I love it
Love the way she plays with my head
She lets me down
Then gets me high
Oh I don't know why she's just my type
[Verse 2: Bradley Simpson ]
This girl's still on repeat
Plays in my mind, won't let me sleep
She's not the one who's in my sheets
'Cause she's no good
She defies all of my dreams
And expectations she won't meet
I'll pack my bags and try to leave
I wish I could

[Pre-Chorus: Bradley Simpson ]
'Cause I need this more than just a one night stand
Need that honey when she hold my hand
Times like this, they call for true romance
But she's not ready for that

[Chorus: Bradley Simpson]
She lets me down
Then gets me high
Oh I don't know why she's just my type
She's bad advice
I don't think twice
Oh I don't know why she's what I like

[Post-Chorus: Bradley Simpson]
But I, I, I love it
I, I, I love it
Love the way she plays with my head
She lets me down
Then gets me high
Oh I don't know why she's just my type
[Bridge: Bradley Simpson]
More than meets the eye
To tell the truth would be a lie
I saw her out again last night, misunderstood
And I'll never be that guy
That cigarette still needs a light
And when I take her back to mine it's nothing good

[Pre-Chorus: Bradley Simpson & Connor Ball]
'Cause I need this more than just a one night stand
Need that honey when she hold my hand
Times like this they call for true romance
But she's not ready for that

[Chorus: Bradley Simpson]
She lets me down
Then gets me high
Oh I don't know why
She's just my type
She's bad advice
I don't think twice
Oh I don't know why she's what I like

[Post-Chorus: Bradley Simpson]
But I, I, I love it
I, I, I love it
Love the way she plays with my head
She lets me down
Then gets me high
Oh I don't know why she's just my type
[Outro: Bradley Simpson]
Oh she's just my type
Yeah she's got just what I like
And she's just my type
Oh yeah she's just my type15Embed

Hair Too Long Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm so sick of staying up losing sleep, who gives a fuck?
Don't you? Don't you?
Lie in bed sometimes at night and miss looking into my eyes
Don't you? 'Cause I do

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna be this cold
Shivering to my bones
Someone reset my soul, oh, oh
And I don't wanna be locked out
I don't wanna feel this doubt
I just wanna scream and shout

[Chorus]
I’ll go out, grow my hair too long
Sing your least favourite song
At the top of my lungs (oh, oh, oh)
I'll go out, kiss all of your friends
Make a story and pretend
It was me who made this end
(Oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
Let me take a second to sympathise 'cause you're right
I'm away too much, I think too much, I drink too much
But it's only a matter of time before we catch up
And I get to say
I wouldn't have it any other way
'Cause it's made me think and drink my way
Back to mistakes I never should have made
One more chance and I'll right the wrongs from yesterday
[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't wanna be locked out
I don't wanna feel this doubt
I just wanna scream and shout

[Chorus]
I’ll go out, grow my hair too long
Sing your least favourite song
At the top of my lungs (oh, oh, oh)
I'll go out, kiss all of your friends
Make a story and pretend
It was me who made this end (oh, oh, oh)
It might seem cruel
You know that the love still hurts
All I do, never, ever seems to work
I’ll go out, grow my hair too long
Sing your least favourite song
At the top of my lungs
(Oh, oh, oh)

[Bridge]
I've been stumbling round
Asking if you're in town
I've been drinking too much
I don't give a ...
[Chorus]
I'll go out, grow my hair too long
Sing your least favourite song
At the top of my lungs

[Chorus]
I'll go out, kiss all of your friends
Make a story and pretend
It was me who made this end (oh, oh, oh)
It might seem cruel
You know that the love still hurts
All I do, never, ever seems to work
I’ll go out, grow my hair too long
Sing your least favourite song
At the top of my lungs
(Oh, oh, oh)

[Outro]
I've been stumbling round (round, round)
Asking if you're in town (town, town)
I've been drinking too much (oh, I know I am)
I don't give a (fuck)
I've been stumbling round (round, round)
Asking if you're in town (town, town)
I've been drinking too much
I don't give a

Somebody to You Lyrics[Intro: The Vamps]
Yeah, you!
Yeah, you!

[Verse 1: Brad Simpson and The Vamps]
I used to wanna be
Living like there's only me
But now I spend my time
Thinking 'bout a way to get you off my mind (Yeah, you!)
I used to be so tough
Never really gave enough
And then you caught my eye
Giving me the feeling of a lightning strike (Yeah, you!)

I can't even talk, still stuttering
This ground I'm on, it keeps shaking
Oh-oh-oh, now!

All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah

But every time I look at you I just don't care
'Cause all I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you (Yeah, you! Hahaha)
[Verse 2: Demi Lovato]
I used to run around
I didn't wanna settle down
But now I wake each day
Looking for a way that I can see your face (Yeah, you!)
I've got your photograph
But, baby, I need more than that
I need to know your lips
Nothing ever mattered to me more than this (Yeah, you!)

Look at me now, I'm falling

I Found a Girl Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hey
This girl moved  into my apartment (one day)
One look at her my heart was stopping (heartbreak)
I did whatever she was asking
She said "maybe later catch you in the elevator"
A couple days we got to hanging (real close)
Turns out she wasn't even taken (no no)
I made a move she said
"Baby you're mistaken, I'm not into bacon"

[Pre-Chorus]
She got that smile and that body is to die for
One of a kind and that's why it makes me cry

[Chorus]
'Cause I found a girl who's in love with a girl
She said that she tried but she's not into guys
Oh, why? Tell me why did I fall for those eyes?
She said I was nice but she's not into guys
I found a girl

[Verse 2]
I should've known to walk away then
I should've left that alone
But why'd you call me on the phone we'll be hanging again
Under the premise of friends
But now she only talks to me about some other woman, she says
[Pre-Chorus]
She got that smile and that body is to die for
One of a kind and that's why it makes me cry

[Chorus]
'Cause I found a girl who's in love with a girl
She said that she tried but she's not into guys
Oh, why? Tell me why did I fall for those eyes?
She said I was nice but she's not into guys
I found a girl
Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh (I found a girl)
Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh

[Bridge]
I can’t believe I met somebody like you
And now I feel like a fool
Anatomy is so cruel
I can’t believe it I just think like a man
That you just wanted me bad
But you had different plans

[Chorus]
'Cause I found a girl who's in love with a girl
She said that she tried but she's not into guys
Oh, why? Tell me why did I fall for those eyes?
She said I was nice but she's not into guys
I found a girl
[Outro]
I found a girl who's in love with a girl
She said that she tried but she's not into guys
Oh, why? Tell me why did I fall for those eyes?
She said I was nice but she's not into guys

Personal Lyrics[Chorus]
Don't take it personal
But personally, I think you'd be better with somebody like me
But worst of all, you don't even see (You don't even see)

[Verse 1]
I think it's time I lay my heart out on the line
I think it's time to say what's playing on my mind
I see you out with him and I say that I'm fine
Happens every time (Every time)

I'm sick and tired of playing games
I'm sick and tired of being second place
And I know if I never try
I'll be sick and tired of being sick and tired

But personally, I think you'd be better with somebody like me
But worst of all, you don't even see (You don't even see)

You know how much I love it when you call me out
You see it in my eyes, the way they follow you around
'Cause yeah, I like the way you dance
You know I do, yeah I do
'Cause that's just you

I'm sick and tired of being friends
I'm sick and tired of being there
And I know if I never try
I'll be sick and tired of being sick and tired

Tell me what you like
Let's make it personal (Personal)

Can We Dance Lyrics[Chorus]
I talk a lot of shit when I'm drinking, baby
I'm known to go a little too fast
Don't mind all my friends, I know they're all crazy
But they're the only friends that I have
I know I don't know you
But I'd like to skip the small talk and romance, girl
That's all I have to say so, baby, can we dance?

[Verse 1]
Here we go again, another drink I'm caving in
Stupid words keep falling from my mouth
You know that I mean well
My hands were meant for somewhere else
Your eyes are doing naughty butterflies

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, one more drink and I should go
Oh, oh, maybe she might like me though
Oh, oh, I just can't think of what to say
Should I go, should I stay?
Just can't let her slip away

[Chorus]
I talk a lot of shit when I'm drinking, baby
I'm known to go a little too fast
Don't mind all my friends, I know they're all crazy
But they're the only friends that I have
I know I don't know you
But I'd like to skip the small talk and romance, girl
That's all I have to say so, baby, can we dance?
[Verse 2]
I was nearly in, but then came in the pushy friend
Killed the vibe and took my perfect ten away
You know I need you, girl
My heart's not made for someone else
Save me here cause I can barely stand

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, one more drink and I should go
Oh, oh, maybe she might like me though
Oh, oh, I just can't take this any more
Should I stay? Should I go?
It'll just lead back to her door

[Chorus]
I talk a lot of shit when I'm drinking, baby
I'm known to go a little too fast
Don't mind all my friends, I know they're all crazy
But they're the only friends that I have
I know I don't know you
But I'd like to skip the small talk and romance, girl
That's all I have to say so, baby, can we dance?

[Bridge]
I've been a bad, bad boy
Whispering rude things in her ear
Please say she'll break
Please say she'll change
Her mind and bring me back to her place
[Chorus]
I talk a lot of shit when I'm drinking, baby
I'm known to go a little too fast
Don't mind all my friends, I know they're all crazy
But they're the only friends that I have
I know I don't know you
But I'd like to skip the small talk and romance, girl
That's all I have to say so, baby, can we dance?

I talk a lot of shit when I'm drinking, baby

Married In Vegas Lyrics[Verse 1]
No good for me or my frame of mind
I think about you all the time
A pretty little thing could wreck me at 25
Just say the words, and I'm all ears
Let's turn a drink into five years
Spend my money, oh, honey, come and bleed me dry

I came here to be someone else
I found you and I found myself
Mister, mister, I'm all in
Bet your house and I'll call it

Feels like the lowest blow
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I think we might get married in Vegas

Pushin' 106 down PCH

Tastes like heartbreak and mistakes, but I can't wait
To walk along that starry strip
I feel it all, it feels like bliss
I show my hand, they look like this

Mister, mister, I'm all in
Bet your house and I'll call it

Even if it's just tonight or the rest of my life
So come on, do your worst
I'll stay here all night
Cash out, cards down, I'll roll the dice

[Interlude]
All these things that I've done
Sin City under the sun
I came to win and I won
I'll leave with you sittin' shotgun
All these things that I've done
Sin City under the sun
I came to win and I won

Feels like a TKO
Feels like the lowest blow
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Missing You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've had space and time to realize the grass ain't greener
And I kinda miss my side
Know I shoulda listened when you told me the first time:
"You won't find another like me"
'Cause I'm sat here in my front room with a girl who ain't you
Hopin' and prayin' you're breakin' up with another fool
Who didn't hear the words that I hear on the same loop:
"You won't find another like me"

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I shoulda loved harder
Put up more of a fight
I know I could've been stronger tonight

[Chorus]
I look for love, but there's a space inside my mind
Where I keep on missing you, I keep on missing you
If you've seen enough, know that I'll be right here
Now with somebody new, I keep on missing you

[Post-Chorus]
You, you

[Verse 2]
I learned every lesson, no more guessing
No more reasons why I should be reminiscing
Instead of saying how I feel (I feel)
Instead of running from what's real (Why)
'Cause I can't keep all this weight on my shoulders
I can't sleep while my bed's getting colder
Strip it back and underneath, I know
I'm scared you'll find another like me
[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I shoulda loved harder
Checked if you were alright
I know I could've seen things in a better light
Now I realize

[Chorus]
I look for love, but there's a space inside my mind
Where I keep on missing you, I keep on missing you
If you've seen enough, know that I'll be right here
Not with somebody new, I keep on missing you

[Post-Chorus]
You, you
You, you

[Bridge]
(I, I keep on missing, I, I keep on missing)
And even though there was nights
(I, I keep on missing, I, I keep on missing)
We'd fight until it subsides
(I, I keep on missing, I, I keep on missing)
And, God, you know that I tried (I, I keep on missing)
But I keep on missing you (I, I keep on missing)

Oh Cecilia (Breaking My Heart) Lyrics[Intro: The Vamps]
Cecilia, you’re breaking my heart
You’re shaking my confidence daily

[Verse 1: Brad]
Put your hands up, you’re surrounded
The whole love thing, I clowned it
Then who’s the joker? I guess I’m it
Cause I let it right go when I found it
Time has never been my best suit
Now I’ve got everything except you
You moved out of my heart, still got the bruise
I’d give it all back to be next to you

I turn my radio up and it’s just my luck,
Why-y-y-y-y-y me??

Why-y-y-y-y-y-eh?

Thought that we could last forever, I was all wrong
Said the talking was cheap and now I'm flat broke
She don’t even wanna see my face anymore
She don’t wanna say, where she's gone away
But she’s on replay in my, in my brain
I’ll do what it takes any time and place
We can turn a breakup into an outbreak

[Pre-Chorus: Brad & Shawn Mendes]
I turn my radio up and it’s just my luck,
Why-y-y-y-y-y me?

When will she finally come back to, come back to me?

Wake Up Lyrics[Verse 1: Brad]
You've been deep in a coma
But I stood right here
When you thought there was no one
I was still right here
You were scared, but I told you
"Open up your eyes"
Never stopped being someone who could love you well
Had to show you the hard way
Only time will tell
Revelations and heartaches make you realize

So wake up

I know sometimes we'll be afraid
But no more playing safe, my dear
