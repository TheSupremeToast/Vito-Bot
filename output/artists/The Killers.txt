Mr. Brightside Lyrics[Verse]
Coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine
Gotta, gotta be down because I want it all
It started out with a kiss; how did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss; it was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag
Now they're going to bed, and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his

[Pre-Chorus]
Chest now, he takes off her
Dress now, let me go
And I just can't look; it's killing me
They're taking control

[Chorus]
Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside
[Instrumental Bridge]

Human Lyrics[Verse 1]
I did my best to notice
When the call came down the line
Up to the platform of surrender
I was brought, but I was kind
And sometimes I get nervous
When I see an open door
Close your eyes, clear your heart

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Cut the cord

[Chorus]
Are we human
Or are we dancer?
My sign is vital
My hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Looking for the answer
Are we human
Or are we dancer?

[Verse 2]
Pay my respects to grace and virtue
Send my condolences to good
Give my regards to soul and romance
They always did the best they could
And so long to devotion
You taught me everything I know
Wave goodbye, wish me well
[Pre-Chorus 2]
You've got to let me go

[Chorus]
Are we human
Or are we dancer?
My sign is vital
My hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Looking for the answer
Are we human
Or are we dancer?

[Bridge]
Will your system be alright
When you dream of home tonight?
There is no message we're receiving
Let me know, is your heart still beating?

[Chorus]
Are we human
Or are we dancer?
My sign is vital
My hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Looking for the answer
[Pre-Chorus 3]
You've got to let me know

[Chorus]
Are we human
Or are we dancer?
My sign is vital
My hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Looking for the answer
Are we human
Or are we dancer?

[Outro]
Are we human
Or are we dancer?
Are we human
Or are we dancer?30Embed

Somebody Told Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Breaking my back just to know your name
Seventeen tracks and I've had it with this game
I'm breaking my back just to know your name
But heaven ain't close in a place like this
Anything goes but don't blink, you might miss

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this
I said, oh, heaven ain't close in a place like this
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight (Ooh-ooh)
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight

[Chorus]
Well, somebody told me you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential

[Verse 2]
Ready? Let's roll onto something new
Taking its toll then I'm leaving without you

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this
I said, oh, heaven ain't close in a place like this
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight (Ooh-ooh)
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight
[Chorus]
Well, somebody told me you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential
A-rushing, rushing around

[Bridge]
Pace yourself for me
I said maybe, baby, please
But I just don't know now (Maybe, baby)
When all I want to do is try

[Chorus]
Well, somebody told me you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential
A-rushing, rushing around
Somebody told me you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential
A-rushing, rushing around
Somebody told me you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential
A-rushing, rushing around55Embed

All These Things That I’ve Done Lyrics[Intro: Brandon Flowers]
When there's nowhere else to run
Is there room for one more son?
One more son
If you can hold on
If you can hold on, hold on
[Verse 1: Brandon Flowers]
I wanna stand up, I wanna let go
You know, you know; no, you don't, you don't
I wanna shine on in the hearts of man
I want a meaning from the back of my broken hand
Another head aches, another heart breaks
I'm so much older than I can take
And my affection, well, it comes and goes
I need direction to perfection, no, no, no, no

[Chorus: Brandon Flowers & Mark Stoermer]
Help me out, yeah
You know you got to help me out, yeah
Oh, don't you put me on the back burner
You know you got to help me out, yeah

[Verse 2: Brandon Flowers]
And when there's nowhere else to run
Is there room for one more son?
These changes ain't changing me
The cold-hearted boy I used to be
[Chorus: Brandon Flowers]
Yeah, you know you got to help me out, yeah
Oh, don't you put me on the back burner
You know you got to help me out, yeah
You're gonna bring yourself down, yeah
You're gonna bring yourself down, yeah
You're gonna bring yourself down

[Bridge: Brandon Flowers, Brandon Flowers & Mark Stoermer, Brandon Flowers, Mark Stoermer & The Sweet Inspirations]
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
(Time, truth, and hearts)

[Chorus: Brandon Flowers & Mark Stoermer]
Yeah, you know you got to help me out, yeah
Oh, don't you put me on the back burner
You know you got to help me out, yeah
You're gonna bring yourself down, yeah
You're gonna bring yourself down, yeah
Oh, don't you put me on the back burner
You're gonna bring yourself down, yeah
You're gonna bring yourself down
[Outro: Brandon Flowers, Mark Stoermer]
Over and in (You're gonna bring yourself down)
Last call for sin (Bring yourself down)
While everyone's lost, the battle is won
With all these things that I've done
All these things that I've done
(Time, truth, and hearts)

When You Were Young Lyrics[Verse 1]
You sit there in your heartache
Waiting on some beautiful boy to
To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness
Watch it now, here he comes

[Chorus 1]
He doesn't look a thing like Jesus
But he talks like a gentlemen
Like you imagined
When you were young

[Verse 2]
Can we climb this mountain? I don't know
Higher now than ever before
I know we can make it if we take it slow
Let's take it easy
Easy now, watch it go

[Chorus 2]
We're burning down the highway skyline
On the back of a hurricane that started turning
When you were young
When you were young
[Interlude]
And sometimes you close your eyes
And see the place where you used to live
When you were young

[Bridge]
They say the devil's water — it ain't so sweet
You don't have to drink right now
But you can dip your feet
Every once in a little while

[Verse 1]
You sit there in your heartache
Waiting on some beautiful boy to
To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness
Watch it now, here he comes

[Chorus 1]
He doesn't look a thing like Jesus
But he talks like a gentlemen
Like you imagined
When you were young
(Talks like a gentleman)
(Like you imagined when)
When you were young

He doesn't look a thing like Jesus

Read My Mind Lyrics[Verse 1]
On the corner of Main Street
Just tryna keep it in line
You say you wanna move on and
You say I'm falling behind
Can you read my mind?
Can you read my mind?

[Verse 2]
I never really gave up on
Breaking out of this two-star town
I got the green light, I got a little fight
I'm gonna turn this thing around
Can you read my mind? (Oooh)
Can you read my mind? (Oooh)

[Chorus]
The good old days, the honest man
The restless heart, the Promised Land
A subtle kiss that no one sees
A broken wrist and a big trapeze
Oh, well, I don't mind if you don't mind
'Cause I don't shine if you don't shine
Before you go, can you read my mind?

[Verse 3]
It’s funny how you just break down
Waiting on some sign
I pull up to the front of your driveway
With magic soaking my spine
Can you read my mind? (Oooh)
Can you read my mind? (Oooh)
[Chorus]
The teenage queen, the loaded gun
The drop dead dream, the Chosen One
A southern drawl, a world unseen
A city wall and a trampoline
Oh, well, I don't mind, if you don't mind
'Cause I don't shine if you don't shine
Before you jump, tell me what you find
When you read my mind

[Bridge]
Slipping in my faith until I fall
He never returned that call
Woman, open the door, don't let it sting
I wanna breathe that fire again
She said, "I don't mind, if you don't mind (I don't mind, if you don't mind)
'Cause I don't shine if you don't shine" (I don't shine if you don't shine)
Put your back on me, put your back on me (I don't mind, if you don't mind)
Oh, put your back on me
Oooh

The stars are blazing like rebel diamonds cut out of the sun
Can you read my mind? (Oooh oooh)27Embed

Run for Cover Lyrics[Verse 1]
What have you gathered to report to your progenitors?
Are your excuses any better than your senator's?
He held a conference and his wife was standing by his side
He did her dirty but no-one died

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I saw Sonny Liston on the street last night
Black-fisted and strong singing Redemption Song
He motioned me to the sky
I heard heaven and thunder cry

[Chorus]
Run for cover
Run while you can, baby, don't look back
You gotta run for cover
Don't be afraid of the fear, that's a played out trap, man
You know you're not the only one
And don't look back, just run for cover

[Verse 2]
What are you waiting for, a kiss or an apology?
You think by now you'd have an A in toxicology
It's hard to pack the car when all you do is shame us
It's even harder when the dirtbag's famous
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I saw my mother on the street last night
All pretty and strong, singing 'the road is long'
I said 'Momma I know you've tried'
But she fell on her knees and cried

[Chorus]
Run for cover
Run while you can, baby, don't look back
You gotta run for cover
Don't be afraid of the fear, that's a played out trap, man
I know you're not the only one
And don't look back, just run for cover

[Bridge]
And there was nothing she wouldn't give
Just to trust him with her nightmares, with her dreams
She's running, she's running
Just to trust him
He got a big smile, he's fake news
Just run for cover, you've got nothing left to lose

[Chorus]
Run for cover
Run while you can, baby, don't look back
You gotta run for cover
Don't be afraid of the fear, that's a played out trap, man
You know you're not the only one
And don't look back, just run for cover

Jenny Was a Friend of Mine Lyrics[Verse 1]
We took a walk that night, but it wasn't the same
We had a fight on the promenade out in the rain
She said she loved me, but she had somewhere to go
She couldn't scream while I held her close
I swore I'd never let her go

[Chorus]
Tell me what you wanna know
Oh, come on, oh, come on, oh, come on
There ain't no motive for this crime
Jenny was a friend of mine
So come on, oh, come on, oh, come on, oh

[Verse 2]
I know my rights, I've been here all day and it's time
For me to go, so let me know if it's alright
I just can't take this, I swear I told you the truth
She couldn't scream while I held her close
I swore I'd never let her go

[Chorus]
Tell me what you wanna know
Oh, come on, oh, come on, oh, come on
And then you whisper in my ear
"I know what you're doing here"
So come on, oh, come on, oh, come on
There ain't no motive for this crime
Jenny was a friend of mine
Oh, come on, oh, come on, oh, come on, oh31Embed

Spaceman Lyrics[Intro]
Oh oh oh
Oh oh o-oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh o-oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh o-oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh o-oh

[Verse 1]
It started with a low light
Next thing I knew, they ripped me from my bed
And then they took my blood type
It left a strange impression in my head
You know that I was hoping
That I could leave this star-crossed world behind
But when they cut me open
I guess I changed my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
And you know, I might
Have just flown too far from the floor this time
'Cause they're calling me by my name
And they're zipping white light beams
Disregarding bombs and satellites
That was the turning point
That was one lonely night
[Chorus]
The storm maker says, "It ain't so bad"
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody, look down
It's all in your mind"

[Verse 2]
Well, now I'm back at home, and
I'm looking forward to this life I live
You know it's gonna haunt me
So hesitation to this life I give
You think you might cross over
You're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
You'd better look it over
Before you make that leap

[Pre-Chorus]
And you know I'm fine
But I hear those voices at night sometimes
They justify my claim
And the public don't dwell on my transmission
'Cause it wasn't televised
But it was the turning point
Oh, what a lonely night

[Chorus]
The storm maker says, "It ain't so bad"
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody, look down
It's all in your mind"
The storm maker says, "It ain't so bad"
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody, look down
It's all in your mind"
[Bridge]
My global position systems are vocally addressed
They say the Nile used to run from east to west
They say the Nile used to run

But I hear those voices at night
Sometimes

The storm maker says, "It ain't so bad"
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody, look down
It's all in your mind"
The storm maker says, "It ain't so bad"
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody, look down
It's all in your mind"
