Fireflies Lyrics[Verse 1]
You would not believe your eyes if ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air and leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare

[Chorus]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs from ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head, a sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread

[Chorus]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

[Bridge]
Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep?
[Verse 3]
To ten million fireflies, I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell (They said farewell)
But I'll know where several are if my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar (Jar, jar, jar)

[Chorus]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

[Chorus]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

[Outro]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Because my dreams are bursting at the seams...90Embed

Vanilla Twilight Lyrics[Verse 1]
The stars lean down to kiss you
And I lie awake and miss you
Pour me a heavy dose of atmosphere
'Cause I'll doze off safe and soundly
But I'll miss your arms around me
I'd send a postcard to you, dear
'Cause I wish you were here

[Verse 2]
I'll watch the night turn light blue
But it's not the same without you
Because it takes two to whisper quietly
The silence isn't so bad
'Til I look at my hands and feel sad
'Cause the spaces between my fingers
Are right where yours fit perfectly
I'll find repose in new ways
Though I haven't slept in two days
'Cause cold nostalgia chills me to the bone
But drenched in vanilla twilight
I'll sit on the front porch all night
Waist-deep in thought because when I think of you
I don't feel so alone

[Bridge]
I don't feel so alone
I don't feel so alone
As many times as I blink, I'll think of you
Tonight (Tonight, tonight, tonight)
I'll think of you tonight
[Verse 3]
When violet eyes get brighter
And heavy wings grow lighter
I'll taste the sky and feel alive again
And I'll forget the world that I knew
But I swear I won't forget you
Oh, if my voice could reach back through the past
I'd whisper in your ear
"Oh darling, I wish you were here"

Not All Heroes Wear Capes Lyrics[Verse 1]
He doesn't fight crime or wear a cape
He doesn't read minds or levitate
But every time my world needs saving
He's my Superman
Some folks don't believe in heroes
'Cause they haven't met my dad

[Verse 2]
He loves his workshop and rock 'n roll
He's got a hot rod and a heart of gold
And you could say he's a man of few words
But he talks a lot within
And even though' I'm a little taller
I still look up to him

[Chorus]
He built me a house in the arms of a tree
He taught me to drive and to fight and to dream
When he looks in my eyes, I hope he can see that
My dad's a hero to me

[Verse 3]
Rust ridden fenders and doors full of dings
Somehow he can fix about anything
I didn't think he knew how to cry
Till our dog died that year
He doesn't always say I love you
But I can hear him loud and clear
[Chorus]
He built me a house in the arms of a tree
He taught me to drive and to fight and to dream
When he looks in my eyes, I hope he can see that
My dad's a hero to me

[Outro]
He built me a house in the arms of a tree
He taught me to drive and to fight and to dream
When he looks in my eyes, I hope he can see
My dad's a hero to me
My dad's a hero to me
My dad's a hero to me3Embed

The Saltwater Room Lyrics[Verse 1]
I opened my eyes last night and saw you in the low light
Walking down by the bay, on the shore
Staring up at the stars that aren't there anymore
I was feeling the night grow old and you were looking so cold
So like an introvert, I drew my over shirt
Around my arms and began to shiver violently before
You happened to look and see the tunnels all around me
Running into the dark underground
All the subways around create a great sound
To my motion fatigue, farewell, with your ear to a seashell
You can hear the waves in underwater caves
As if you actually were inside a saltwater room

[Chorus: Adam Young & Breanne Duren]
Time together is just never quite enough
When you and I are alone, I've never felt so at home
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
Only time, only time

[Verse 2: Adam Young]
Can you believe that the crew has gone
And they wouldn't let me sign on?
All my islands have sunk in the deep
So I can hardly relax or even oversleep
But I feel warm with your hand in mine
When we walk along the shoreline
I guess we'll never know why sparrows love the snow
We'll turn out all of the lights and set this ballroom aglow
[Interlude: Adam Young & Breanne Duren]
So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
Yeah all the time
All the time

[Chorus: Adam Young & Breanne Duren]
Time together is just never quite enough
When you and I are alone, I've never felt so at home
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
Only time, only time

[Bridge: Adam Young & Breanne Duren]
When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?
If this is what I call home, why does it feel so alone?
So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
All the time, all the time

[Outro: Adam Young & Breanne Duren]
Time together is just never quite enough
When we're apart what ever are you thinking of?
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
So tell me darling do you wish we'd fall in love?
All the time
Oh, all the time7Embed

When Can I See You Again? Lyrics[Intro]
(When can we do this again?
When can I see you again?
When can we do this again?
When can I see you again?
When can we do this again?
When can I see you again, gain, gain, gain?)

[Verse 1]
Switch on the sky and the stars glow for you
Go see the world 'cause it’s all so brand new
Don’t close your eyes 'cause your future’s ready to shine
It’s just a matter of time before we learn how to fly
Welcome to the rhythm of the night
There’s something in the air you can’t deny (Deny)

It's been fun but now I've got to go
Life is way too short to take it slow
But before I go and hit the road
I got to know, 'til then, when can we do this again?

Oh oh, oh oh
When can I see you again?
Oh oh, oh oh
When can we do this again?
Woah oh, oh oh
I got to know (got to know), when can I see you again? (See you again)

Joined at the hip, yeah, your sidekick needs you
Life is a trip and a road map leads you
Look all around at the mountains you haven't climbed
It's just a matter of time before we learn how to fly
Welcome to the rhythm of the night
There's something in the air you can't deny (Deny)

It's been fun but now I've got to go

But before I go and hit the road (You know!)

When can we do this again?

Don't close your eyes 'cause your future's ready to shine
It's just a matter of time before we learn how to fly
Welcome to the rhythm of the night
There's something in the air you can't deny
So let me know before I wave goodbye

When can I see you again?
Oh oh, oh oh
When can we do this again?
Oh oh, oh oh
When can I see you again?

When can we do this again?

Life is way too short to take it slow

Tell me when
When can I see you again?

Enchanted Lyrics[Verse 1]
There I was again tonight forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
Your eyes whispered "have we met?"
Across the room your silhouette starts to make it's way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks like passing notes in secrecy
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
Oh, Taylor, I was so enchanted to meet you too

[Chorus]
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you too

[Verse 2]
The lingering question kept me up
2 AM, who do you love?
I wondered till I'm wide awake
Now I'm pacing back and forth, wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
It was enchanting to meet you
Oh, Taylor, I was so enchanted to meet you too
[Chorus]
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you too

[Bridge]
This is me praying that this was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name until I see you again
These are the words I held back as I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you too
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

[Chorus]
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
Taylor I'll spend my whole life wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you too
[Outro]
I was never in love with someone else
I never had somebody waiting on me
'Cause you were all of my dreams come true
And I just wish you knew
Taylor, I was so in love with you2Embed

This Isn’t the End Lyrics[Intro: Adam Young]
An 8 year old girl had a panic attack
Cause the father she loved left and never looked back
No longer the hero, she counted on
He told her he loved her and then he was gone

[Verse 1: Adam Young]
She tried to look happy in front of her friends
But knew that she'd never feel normal again
She fought back the tears as they filled her eyes
And wanted him back just to tell him goodbye

[Chorus: Adam Young]
When the rain falls down
When it all turns around
When the light goes out this isn't the end

[Verse 2: Adam Young]
Her dad was a good guy that everyone liked
But nobody knew he was dying inside
He promised his family he'd be all right
And then with a gunshot he left them behind

[Chorus: Adam Young]
When the rain falls down
When it all turns around
When the light goes out this isn't the end
When the rain falls down
When it all turns around
When the light goes out this isn't the end
[Verse 3: Adam Young]
The role of a father, he never deserved
He abandoned his daughter and never returned
And over the years though the pain was real
She finally forgave him, and started to heal

[Bridge: Adam Young]
How close is the ending? Well, nobody knows
The future's a mystery and anything goes
Love is confusing and life is hard
You fight to survive cause you made it this far

[Outro: Adam Young]
It's all too astounding to comprehend
It's just the beginning this isn't the end
It's just the beginning this isn't the end6Embed

Lucid Dream Lyrics[Verse 1]
I am a light sleeper
But I am a heavy dreamer
My imagination gives me wings
And I can go anywhere

[Pre-Chorus]
And when I wander away
To some other place
I'm suddenly there
Way up in the air
Where passenger trains
Catch fire and fill the sky with flames
And that black rabbit of death
Wakes up in a breath
Of beautiful dreams
My heartache, it seems
So terribly vain
Where fire and diamonds fall like rain

[Chorus]
Do you believe
In endless miracles?
Do you believe
In the impossible?
Do you believe
Sleep is a time machine?
Do you believe
In curiosity?
Do you believe
In what you cannot see?
Do you believe
Life is a lucid dream?
[Post-Chorus]
That’s how you study the stars
That’s how you study the stars
And that’s how you know them by heart
Life is a lucid dream

[Verse 2]
Such is the path of a dreamer
I find my way by moonlight
My imagination gives me wings
And I can go anywhere

[Pre-Chorus]
And when I wander away
To some other place
I'm suddenly there
Way up in the air
Where passenger trains
Catch fire and fill the sky with flames
And that black rabbit of death
Wakes up in a breath
Of beautiful dreams
My heartache, it seems
So terribly vain
Where fire and diamonds fall like rain
[Chorus]
Do you believe
In endless miracles?
Do you believe
In the impossible?
Do you believe
Sleep is a time machine?
Do you believe
In curiosity?
Do you believe
In what you cannot see?
Do you believe
Life is a lucid dream?

[Post-Chorus]
Well, that’s how you study the stars
That’s how you study the stars
And that’s how you know them by heart
Life is a lucid dream
Well, that’s how you study the stars
That’s how you study the stars
And that’s how you know them by heart
Life is a lucid dream

New York City Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm digging through the glove box
I thought I had a map in here
The driver's door doesn't lock
I bought the car my junior year
There's candy in my backpack
And you can pick our soundtrack
We're heading for the East Coast tonight
So pack your bags and hold on tight
'Cause we're taking off
We're taking off

[Chorus]
Run away with me
We're on the way to New York City
Take my hand and see
Manhattan never looked so pretty
Travel light and see the world right
You'll never know if you never go, so
Run away with me
And say, "Hello," to New York City

[Verse 2]
Feet up on the dashboard
We're driving with the windows down
Did you forget your phone cord?
We'll buy one in the next small town
Get dinner at an IHOP
A shower at a truck stop
We'll listen to some Johnny Cash
Take my hand and don't look back
'Cause we're moving on
We're moving on
[Chorus]
Run away with me
We're on the way to New York City
Take my hand and see
Manhattan never looked so pretty
Travel light and see the world right
You'll never know if you never go, so
Run away with me
And say, "Hello," to New York City

[Bridge]
Run away
Run away
Run away
Run away

[Chorus]
Run away with me
We're on the way to New York City
Take my hand and see
Manhattan never looked so pretty
Travel light and see the world right
You'll never know if you never go, so
Run away with me...

[Outro]
Stroll the midtown streets
And tell me that you don't feel giddy
Lady Liberty
Ain't throwing us a wink or is she?
Travel light and see the world right
You'll never know if you never go so
Run away with me
And say, "Hello," to New York City
Say, "Hello," to New York City
Say, "Hello," to New York City5Embed
