What You Know Lyrics[Verse 1]
In a few weeks, I will get time
To realise it's right before my eyes
And I can take it if it's what I want to do
I am leaving and this is starting
To feel like it's right before my eyes
And I can taste it, it's my sweet beginning

[Chorus]
And I can tell just what you want
You don't want to be alone
You don't want to be alone
And I can't say it's what you know
But you've known it the whole time
Yeah, you've known it the whole time

[Verse 2]
Maybe next year, I'll have no time
To think about the questions to address
Am I the one to try to stop the fire?
I wouldn't test you, I'm not the best you
Could have obtained, why try anything?
I will get there; just remember, I know

[Chorus]
And I can tell just what you want
You don't want to be alone
You don't want to be alone
And I can't say it's what you know
But you've known it the whole time
Yeah, you've known it the whole time
[Chorus]
And I can tell just what you want
You don't want to be alone
You don't want to be alone
And I can't say it's what you know
But you've known it the whole time
Yeah, you've known it the whole time52Embed

Undercover Martyn Lyrics[Verse 1]
And she spoke words that would melt in your hands
And she spoke words of wisdom
To the basement, people, to the basement
Many surprises await you
In the basement, people, in the basement

[Chorus]
You hid there last time, you know we're gonna find you
Sick in the car seat, 'cause you're not up to going
Out on the main streets, completing your mission
You hid there last time, you know we're gonna find you
Sick in the car seat, 'cause you're not up to going
Out on the main streets, completing your mission

Something Good Can Work Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's a spanner in the works, you know
You gotta step up your game to make it to the top
So go
Got a little competition now
You're going to find it hard to cope with living on your own now
Uh oh, uh oh

[Chorus]
Let's make this happen, girl
We gotta show the world that something good can work
And it can work for you, and you know that it will
Let's get this started, girl
We're moving up, we're moving up
It's been a lot to change but you will always get what you want

[Verse 2]
It took a little time to make a little better
It's only going up, just one thing then another
You know, you know
It took a little time to make a little better
It's only going up, just one thing then another
You know, you know

[Chorus]
Let's make this happen, girl
We gotta show the world that something good can work
And it can work for you, and you know that it will

Sun Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ocean blue
What have I done to you?
Cut so deep
Yet growing through and through

[Verse 2]
Drawn apart, New York and London
All I see now are distant drumlins
The roads I knew became a city
And I wonder, will you wait for me?

[Chorus]
Although I'm far away
I know I'll stay
I know I'll stay
Right there with you
Though it might be too late
What would you say?
What would you say?
What would you do?

[Verse 3]
I built a hive, became one with the bees
But we fell like rain, got lost into the sea
If I don't know, the wind will carry me
So just hold tight
[Chorus]
Although I'm far away
I know I'll stay
I know I'll stay
Right there with you
Though it might be too late
What would you say?
What would you say?
What would you do?

[Bridge]
Over and over many setting suns
I have run, I have waited for the rain to come
When through that mist, I see the shape of you
And I know, and I know that I'm in love with you

[Chorus]
Although I'm far away
I know I'll stay
I know I'll stay
Right there with you
Though it might be too late
What would you say?
What would you say?
What would you do?13Embed

Changing of the Seasons Lyrics[Verse 1]
So it's over, I didn't realize
It's so much colder
But it was no surprise
Did you ever get to know me?
'Cause it has never been so plain to see

[Chorus]
And when you say you won't forget me
Well I can tell you that's untrue
'Cause every day since you left me
I thought less and less of you
And I've worn out all the reasons
To keep on knocking at your door
Could be the changing of the seasons
But I don't love you anymore

[Verse 2]
The door is open, you whispered to me
As you stood frozen in deep uncertainty
I hope that you know what I am thinking
Before you go with your heart sinking

[Chorus]
And when you say you won't forget me
Well I can tell you that's untrue
'Cause every day since you left me
I thought less and less of you
And I've worn out all the reasons
To keep on knocking at your door
Could be the changing of the seasons
But I don't love you anymore, anymore
Anymore
[Bridge]
You said "Come back and spend the night
Come back and spend the night with me"

You said "Come back and spend the night
Come back and spend the night with me"
You said "Come back and spend the night
Come back and spend the night with me"
You said "Come back and spend the night
Come back and spend the night with me"

[Chorus]
And when you say you won't forget me
Well I can tell you that's untrue
'Cause every day since you left me
I thought less and less of you
And I've worn out all the reasons
To keep on knocking at your door
Could be the changing of the seasons
But I don't love you anymore17Embed

[Verse 1]
You're the sacred cow
Stand up, take a bow, you're wonderful
You should be comfortable, don't think at all
Just don't think at all, think at all

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now, now you're digging a wreck
What will you write about?
How did you find that out?
You get paid (paid) and don't need any respect
Senses fading, she's no lady
[Chorus (Intro)]
Oh, we've made a mistake (Na na na na na)
We've lost our minds (Na na na na na)
We've lost our memory (Na na na na na)
Oh, what's it gonna take? (Na na na na na)
There's always something else (Na na na na na)
Waiting on the shelf (Na na na na na)

[Verse 2]
You could be president
You never paid the rent but I don't mind
You got no reason to learn what came first
It can't be good enough, good enough

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Now, now you're throwing the stone
You never sympathize
Somebody shut your eye
What will you say with that mind of your own?
Are we ready? Hold it steady

I saw the world today
It comes in green and gray
Refrigerator hum
And chewing gum and instant karma
The war's a whore
And all the stores are bored with all your money
We follow what's to come
That's what they sold to me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Now, now you're throwing the stone
You never sympathize
Somebody shut your eye
What will you say with that mind of your own?
Are we ready? Hold it steady

Bad Decisions Lyrics[Verse 1]
Save me
I've been drinking wine
And I just made a big mistake
Happens all the time
Slay me
Come out from the dark
Sold my soul to television
Different kind of art

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll be okay
We'll be okay, ah

[Chorus]
We've got the time
Gonna work, it's worth it
Found the perfect crime
You don't need to know what everybody's thinking
Looking back at yourself
Fighter pilot vision
Outside the line
Oh, come to me, my fantasy tonight
I'll apologize for everything later
I'm addicted to you
And I make bad decisions
[Verse 2]
Lately
Think I've had enough
Of generation information, every station
But I can't turn it off
So, baby
Why you look so sad?
You've been trying too hard, too hard to be happy
Where's the sense in that?

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll be okay
We'll be okay, ah

[Chorus]
We've got the time
Gonna work, it's worth it
Found the perfect crime
You don't need to know what everybody's thinking
Looking back at yourself
Fighter pilot vision
Outside the line
Oh, come to me, my fantasy tonight
I'll apologize for everything later
I'm addicted to you
And I make bad decisions

Sleep Alone Lyrics[Verse 1]
Know my only goal is to see
When I'm only fast asleep
It takes more than strength to find
This peace of mind

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'll hold, hold, hold
Hold it close
To my heart beating with every step
Hold, hold, hold it close

[Chorus]
He sleeps alone
He needs no army where he's headed 'cause he knows
That they're just ghosts
And they can't hurt him if he can't see them, oh
And I may go
To places I have never been to just to find
The deepest desires in my mind

[Verse 2]
We, we only know what we see
'Cause we're always fast asleep
Is it so hard not to believe
That we'll never know?
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, hold, hold, hold
Hold me close
I've never been this far from home
Hold, hold, hold me close

[Chorus]
He sleeps alone
He needs no army where he's headed 'cause he knows
That they're just ghosts
And they can't hurt him if he can't see them, oh
And I may go
To places I have never been to just to find
The deepest desires in my mind

[Bridge]
It's in my head and I have said
That I must be like him now
He sleeps alone
He sleeps alone
And one last chance to make sense
Of what has long escaped us
He sleeps alone
I sleep alone

[Chorus]
He sleeps alone
He needs no army where he's headed 'cause he knows
That they're just ghosts
And they can't hurt him if he can't see them, oh
And I don't know
If in the morning I will be here, and if so
Let it be known
That I was worthy, I was worthy, I was worthy, I was21Embed

Next Year Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't know where I am going to rest my head tonight
So I won't promise that I'll speak to you today
But if I ever find another place, a better time
For that moment, I was never what I am

[Pre-Chorus]
Take me to where you are, what you've become
And what you will do when I am gone
I won't forget, I won't forget

[Chorus]
Maybe someday, you'll be somewhere
Talking to me as if you knew me, saying
I'll be home for next year, darling
I'll be home for next year

[Verse 2]
In between the lines is the only place you'll find
What you're missing but you didn't know was there
So when I say goodbye, you must do your best to try
And forgive me this weakness, this weakness

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I don't know what to say, another day
Another excuse to be sent your way
Another day, another year
[Chorus]
Maybe someday, you'll be somewhere
Talking to me as if you knew me, saying
I'll be home for next year, darling
I'll be home for next year

And maybe sometime, in a long time
You'll remember what I had said there, I said
I'll be home for next year, darling
I'll be home for next year

I will think of you

Maybe someday, you'll be somewhere
Talking to me as if you knew me, saying

[Verse 1]
You won't believe what I tell you
White coats and clever minds will choose
You get a lot from this, loose tongue and arrogance
It's not appropriate, don't think that this is it

[Chorus]
Now I can talk, no one gets off
I know how you'd like to
Now I can talk, no one gets off
Now I can talk, no one gets off
I know how you'd like to
Now I can talk, no one gets off

[Verse 2]
A longer sentence brings no more
Than one that I had said before
It's hard to compromise when I see through your eyes
It's just a common view, I guess it's lost on you
[Chorus]
Now I can talk, no one gets off
I know how you'd like to
Now I can talk, no one gets off
Now I can talk, no one gets off
I know how you'd like to
Now I can talk, no one gets off
