Chop Suey! Lyrics[Intro: Serj Tankian]
We're rolling "Suicide"

[Verse: Serj Tankian]
Wake up (Wake up)
Grab a brush and put a little makeup
Hide your scars to fade away the shakeup (Hide the scars to fade away the shakeup)
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?
Here you go, create another fable, you wanted to
Grab a brush and put a little makeup, you wanted to
Hide the scars to fade away the shakeup, you wanted to
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table? You wanted to

[Chorus: Serj Tankian with Daron Malakian]
I don't think you trust
In my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die

[Verse: Serj Tankian]
Ah! Wake up (Wake up)
Grab a brush and put a little makeup (A little bit)
Hide the scars to fade away the (Hide the scars to fade away the shakeup)
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?
Here you go, create another fable, you wanted to
Grab a brush and put a little makeup, you wanted to
Hide the scars to fade away the shakeup, you wanted to
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table? You wanted to
[Chorus: Serj Tankian with Daron Malakian]
I don't think you trust
In my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die
In my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die

[Bridge: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Father, father, father, father
Father, father, father, father
Father, into your hands I commend my spirit
Father, into your hands
Why have you forsaken me?
In your eyes, forsaken me?
In your thoughts, forsaken me?
In your heart, forsaken me? Oh

[Outro: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Trust in my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die
In my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die166Embed

Toxicity Lyrics[Produced by Rick Rubin, Daron Malakian, Serj Tankian]

[Verse 1]
Conversion, software version 7.0
Looking at life through the eyes of a tire hub
Eating seeds as a pastime activity
The toxicity of our city, of our city

[Chorus]
You, what do you own the world? How do you own disorder, disorder?
Now, somewhere between the sacred silence, sacred silence and sleep
Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep
Disorder, disorder, disorder

[Verse 2]
More wood for their fires, loud neighbors
Flashlight reveries caught in the headlights of a truck
Eating seeds as a pastime activity
The toxicity of our city, of our city

[Chorus]
You, what do you own the world? How do you own disorder, disorder?
Now, somewhere between the sacred silence, sacred silence and sleep
Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep
Disorder, disorder, disorder
[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
You, what do you own the world? How do you own disorder?
Now, somewhere between the sacred silence, sacred silence and sleep
Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep
Disorder, disorder, disorder

B.Y.O.B. Lyrics[Intro: Daron Malakian]
You!
Why do they always send the poor?

[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Barbarisms by Barbaras with pointed heels
Victorious Victoriaâ€™s kneel for brand new spanking deals
Marching forward, hypocritic and hypnotic computers
You depend on our protection, yet you feed us lies from the table cloth

[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, ooh-ooh
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine

[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Kneeling roses disappearing into Moses' dry mouth
Breaking into Fort Knox, stealing our intentions
Hangars sitting dripped in oil, crying, "Freedom"
Handed to obsoletion, still, you feed us lies from the table cloth

[Chorus: Serj Tankian with Daron Malakian]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, ooh-ooh
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine
[Bridge: Daron Malakian]
Blast off, it's party time
And we don't live in a fascist nation
Blast off, it's party time
And where the fuck are you?

[Refrain: Daron Malakian with Serj Tankian]
Where the fuck are you?
Where the fuck are you?
Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why they always send the poor?

[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Kneeling roses disappearing into Moses' dry mouth
Breaking into Fort Knox, stealing our intentions
Hangars sitting dripped in oil, crying, "Freedom"
Handed to obsoletion, still, you feed us lies from the table cloth

[Chorus: Serj Tankian with Daron Malakian]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, ooh-ooh
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sun
[Refrain: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Where the fuck are you?
Where the fuck are you?
Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?

[Outro: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Why do they always send the poor?

Why do they always send the poor?

Aerials Lyrics[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Life is a waterfall
We're one in the river and one again after the fall
Swimming through the void, we hear the word
We lose ourselves, but we find it all
'Cause we are the ones that wanna play
Always wanna go, but you never wanna stay
And we are the ones that wanna choose
Always wanna play, but you never wanna lose

[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Aerials in the sky
When you lose small mind, you free your life

[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Life is a waterfall
We drink from the river then we turn around and put up our walls
Swimming through the void, we hear the word
We lose ourselves, but we find it all
'Cause we are the ones that wanna play
Always wanna go, but you never wanna stay
And we are the ones that wanna choose
Always wanna play, but you never wanna lose, oh

[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Aerials in the sky
When you lose small mind, you free your life
Aerials, so up high
When you free your eyes, eternal prize

When you lose small mind, you free your life

I'm not there all the time, you know
Some people, some people, some people call it insane
Yeah, they call it insane (Sugar)
I play Russian Roulette every day, a man's sport

I got a gun the other day from Sako
It's cute, it's small, fits right in my pocket
Yeah, right in my pocket (Sugar)
My girl, you know, she lashes out at me sometimes
And I just fucking kick her
And then, ooh baby, she's okay (Sugar)
People are always chasing me down
Tryna push my face to the ground
Where all they do is suck out my motherfucking brains

The Kombucha mushroom people, sitting around all day
Who can believe you? Who can believe you?

[Outro: Serj Tankian]
I sit in my desolate room
No lights, no music
Just anger, I killed everyone
I'm away forever, but I'm feeling better
How do I feel? What do I say?
Fuck you, it all goes away
How do I feel? What do I say?
Fuck you, it all goes away
How do I feel? What do I say?
In the end, it all goes away

Prison Song Lyrics[Intro: Serj Tankian]
They're tryna build a prison

Following the rights movements, you clamped down with your iron fists
Drugs became conveniently available for all the kids
Following the rights movements, you clamped down with your iron fists
Drugs became conveniently available for all the kids

[Pre-Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
I buy my crack, my smack, my bitch
Right here in Hollywood
Nearly two million Americans are incarcerated
In the prison system, prison system of the US

They're tryna build a prison
They're tryna build a prison
They're tryna build a prison
They're tryna build a prison
For you and me to live in
Another prison system
Another prison system
Another prison system
For you and me
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Minor drug offenders fill your prisons, you don't even flinch
All our taxes paying for your wars against the new non-rich
Minor drug offenders fill your prisons, you don't even flinch
All our taxes paying for your wars against the new non-rich

[Pre-Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]

Utilizing drugs to pay for secret wars around the world
Drugs are now your global policy, now you police the globe

Drug money is used to rig elections and train brutal

Soldier Side Lyrics[Verse 1: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Dead man lying on the bottom of the grave
Wondering when savior comes, is he gonna be saved?
Maybe you're a sinner into your alternate life
Maybe you're a joker, maybe you deserve to die

[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
They were crying when their sons left, God is wearing black
He's gone so far to find no hope, he's never coming back
They were crying when their sons left, all young men must go
He's come so far to find the truth, he's never going home

[Verse 2: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Young men standing on the top of their own graves
Wondering when Jesus comes, are they gonna be saved?
Cruelty to the winner, bishop tells the king his lies
Maybe you're a mourner, maybe you deserve to die

They were crying when their sons left, God is wearing black
He's gone so far to find no hope, he's never coming back

He's come so far to find the truth, he's never going home

People all grow up to die, there is no one here but me
Welcome to the soldier side, there is no one here but me
People on the soldier side, there is no one here but me
