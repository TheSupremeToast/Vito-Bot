Canâ€™t Help Falling in Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Wise men say only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you

[Verse 2]
Shall I stay? Would it be a sin
If I can't help falling in love with you?

[Chorus]
Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be

[Verse 3]
Take my hand, take my whole life, too
For I can't help falling in love with you

[Chorus]
Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be

[Outro]
Take my hand, take my whole life, too
For I can't help falling in love with you
For I can't help falling in love with you110Embed

Jailhouse Rock Lyrics[Verse 1]
The warden threw a party in the county jail
The prison band was there and they began to wail
The band was jumping and the joint began to swing
You shoulda heard those knocked out jailbirds sing

[Chorus]
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

[Verse 2]
Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone
Little Joey blowing on the slide trombone
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang
The whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang

[Chorus]
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

[Verse 3]
Number forty-seven said to number three
"You the cutest jailbird I ever did see
I sure would be delighted with your company
Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me"
[Chorus]
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
Rock, rock, rock

{Guitar Solo}

[Verse 4]
Sad Sack was sitting on a block of stone
Way over in the corner weeping all alone
The warden said, "Hey, buddy, don't you be no square
You can't find a partner, use a wooden chair"

[Chorus]
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

[Verse 5]
Shifty Henry said to Bugs, "For Heaven's sake
No one's looking, now's our chance to make a break"
Bugsy turned to Shifty and he said, "Nix nix
I wanna stick around a while and get my kicks."

[Chorus]
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
[Outro]
Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

Suspicious Minds Lyrics[Verse 1]
We're caught in a trap, I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Why can't you see, what you're doin' to me
When you don't believe a word I say?

[Chorus]
We can't go on together
With suspicious minds (with suspicious minds)
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

[Verse 2]
So, if an old friend I know, stops by to say hello
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?
Here we go again, asking where I've been
You can't see the tears are real, I'm cryin'
(Yes, I'm cryin')

[Chorus]
We can't go on together
With suspicious minds (with suspicious minds)
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

[Bridge]
Oh, let our love survive
I'll dry the tears from your eyes
Let's don't let a good thing die
When, honey, you know I've never lied to you
[Verse 1]
We're caught in a trap, I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Why can't you see, what you're doin' to me
When you don't believe a word I say?

Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap? I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap? I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap? I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap? I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap? I can't walk out

Heartbreak Hotel Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, since my baby left me
Well, I found a new place to dwell
Well, it's down at the end of Lonely Street
At Heartbreak Hotel

[Chorus]
Where I'll be, I'll be so lonely, baby
Well, I'm so lonely
I'll be so lonely, I could die

[Verse 2]
Although it's always crowded
You still can find some room
For broken-hearted lovers
To cry there in their gloom

[Chorus]
They'll be, they'll be so lonely, baby
They'll be so lonely
They're so lonely, they could die

[Verse 3]
Now, the bellhop's tears keep flowin'
And the desk clerk's dressed in black
Well, they've been so long on Lonely Street
They'll never, never look back
[Chorus]
And they get so, they get so lonely, baby
Well, they are so lonely
They're so lonely, they could die

[Verse 4]
Well, now, if your baby leaves you
And you got a tale to tell
Well, just take a walk down Lonely Street
To Heartbreak Hotel

Where you will be, you will be, you'll be so lonely, baby
Well, you will be lonely
You'll be so lonely, you could die

Although it's always crowded
You still can find some room
For broken-hearted lovers
To cry there in their gloom

Are You Lonesome Tonight? Lyrics[Verse 1]
Are you lonesome tonight? Do you miss me tonight?
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memory stray to a brighter summer day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?

[Verse 2]
Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again?
Tell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight?

[Spoken]
I wonder if you are lonesome tonight
You know someone said that the world's a stage and each must play a part
Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweetheart
Act one was where we met
I loved you at first glance
You read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came act two
You seemed to change, you acted strange
And why, I've never known
Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than to go on living without you
Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then they can bring the curtain down
[Outro]
Is your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again?
Tell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight?5Embed

In the Ghetto Lyrics[Verse 1]
As the snow flies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
A poor little baby child is born
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)
And his mama cries
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)

[Bridge]
People, don't you understand
A child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me
Are we too blind to see
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way?

[Verse 2]
Well, the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)
And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal and he learns how to fight
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)
[Bridge]
Then one night in desperation
The young man breaks away
He buys a gun, he steals a car
Tries to run, but he don't get far

[Verse 3]
And his mama cries
As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Facedown on the street with a gun in his hand
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)
And as her young man dies (In the ghetto)
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)

[Outro]
And his mama cries
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)
(In the ghetto)6Embed

Blue Suede Shoes Lyrics[Intro]
Well, it's one for the money, two for the show
Three to get ready, now go, cat, go

[Chorus]
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything, but stay off of my blue suede shoes

Well, you can knock me down, step in my face
Slander my name all over the place

You can burn my house, steal my car
Drink my liquor from an old fruit jar
Do anything that you want to do

Well, you can do anything, but lay off of my blue suede shoes

If I Can Dream Lyrics[Verse 1]
There must be lights burning brighter somewhere
Got to be birds flying higher in a sky more blue
If I can dream of a better land, where all my brothers walk hand in hand
Tell me why, oh why, oh why can't my dream come true, oh why

[Verse 2]
There must be peace and understanding sometime
Strong wind of promise that will blow away the doubt and fear
If I can dream of a warmer sun, where hope keeps shining on everyone
Tell me why, oh why, oh why won't that sun appear

[Bridge]
We're lost in a cloud with too much rain
We're trapped in a world that's troubled with pain
But as long as a man has the strength to dream
He can redeem his soul and fly (He can fly)

[Verse 3]
Deep in my heart, there's a trembling question
Still, I am sure that the answer's... answer's gonna come somehow
Out there in the dark, there's a beckoning candle, yeah
And while I can think, while I can talk, while I can stand, while I can walk
While I can dream, oh, please let my dream come true, oh, right now

[Outro]
Let it come true right now
Oh, yeah12Embed
