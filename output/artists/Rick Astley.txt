Never Gonna Give You Up Lyrics[Intro]

[Verse 1]
We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand

[Chorus]
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
[Verse 2]
We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it
Inside, we both know what's been going on
We know the game, and we're gonna play it
[Pre-Chorus]
And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see

[Chorus]
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh (Give you up)
Ooh-ooh (Give you up)
Ooh-ooh
Never gonna give, never gonna give (Give you up)
Ooh-ooh
Never gonna give, never gonna give (Give you up)
[Bridge]
We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it
Inside, we both know what's been going on
We know the game, and we're gonna play it

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand

[Chorus]
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you118Embed

Dance Lyrics[Verse 1]
God walks home through the local park
Meets the devil with a broken heart
He says
"I've been let down by the armies of darkness
Oh my whole life's a mess"
And God says

[Pre-Chorus]
"I got the cure
I'm holding on to something pure
I got the cure for you

[Chorus]
All you gotta do is dance
Pick your feet up
All you gotta do is dance
Feel the beat, love
All you've gotta do is dance
Dance with me"

[Verse 2]
Now the devil thanks God and he's on his way
Skip in his stride, what a beautiful day
And then along comes a slacker with some fun in his hand
Beelzebub knows he's got to save this man
And the devil says
[Pre-Chorus]
"I got the cure
I'm holding on to something pure
I got the cure for you

[Chorus]
All you gotta do is dance
Pick your feet up
All you gotta do is dance
Feel the beat, love
All you've gotta do is dance
Dance with me
All you gotta do is dance
Pick your feet up
All you gotta do is dance
Feel the beat, love
All you've gotta do is dance
Dance with me"

[Bridge]
The trees became a multitude of angels
Singing out like a gospel choir
And the benches in the park rose up
To become their chariots of fire
Oh fire, yeah
They rose up
They rose up
To become their chariots of fire
(And the benches in the park rose up
And they dance with God and Beelzebub)
God said
[Chorus]
"All you gotta do is dance
Pick your feet up
All you gotta do is dance
Feel the beat, love
All you've gotta do is dance
Dance with me
All you gotta do is dance
Pick your feet up
All you gotta do is dance
Feel the beat, love
All you've gotta do is dance
Dance with me
All you gotta do is dance
Pick your feet up
All you gotta do is dance
Feel the beat, love
All you've gotta do is dance
Dance with me"1Embed

Keep Singing Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I was a boy
I saw my daddy crying at the steering wheel
And oh, it made me feel so scared
Then there was joy
From my religion, swimming in a choir of voices
And oh, I knew that I'd been spared

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That I'd be saved some sunny day
Saved from throwing my life away
That I'd be saved some sunny day
From throwing my life, throwing my life away

[Chorus 1]
Keep singing, woah, I keep singing
Praising to the heavens with my voice ringing
Keep singing, woah, I keep singing
Clap to the beat till my hands are stinging
And I'd be saved some sunny day
From throwing my life, throwing my life away

[Verse 2]
And now I understand
I'm a wide-eyed father, and blessed are the children
Oh, our greatest reward
And with these hands
I'll move a mountain, build a castle to keep you safe
Of this you know you can be sure
[Pre-Chorus 2]
And you'll be saved some sunny day
Saved from throwing your life away
And you'll be saved some sunny day
From throwing your life

[Chorus 2]
Keep singing, woah, keep singing
Praising to the heavens with your voices ringing
Keep singing, woah, keep singing
Clap to the beat til your hands are stinging
And you'll be saved some sunny day
From throwing your life, throwing your life away

[Bridge]
Who do you love?
When it all comes down to truth
Who do you love?
When it all comes back to you
Who do you love?
When you're lying in your bed
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

[Bridge]
Keep singing, woah, keep singing
Pray, keep singing, woah, keep singing
Pray, keep singing, woah, keep singing
Pray, keep singing, woah, keep singing
[Outro]
And you'll be saved some sunny day
From throwing your life, throwing your life away2Embed

Whenever You Need Somebody LyricsI'll bring my love to you
I'll bring my love to you

[Verse 1]
I've been stood up and messed around and taken for a fool
But next time 'round, I'm gonna change the rules
And I don't care about things that people say
It's you I think about each and every day
It's much too late for you to change your ways
I can't keep holding on expecting you to stay
When you're all alone and if you're feeling down
Call me, I'll be around

[Chorus]
Whenever you need somebody
I'll bring my love to you
You don't have to say you love me
I just wanna be with you

[Verse 2]
Lost inside your love is where I wanna be
I'm just asking you to spend some time with me
Time and time you say you wanna be free
And you can have some fun, that's okay with me
You will never know just how good I feel
The joy inside of me makes me feel so real
When you're all alone and if you're feeling down
Call me, and I'll be around
[Chorus]
Whenever you need somebody
I'll bring my love to you
You don't have to say you love me
I just wanna be with you

I'll bring my love to you
I just wanna be with you

It's much too late for you to change your ways
I can't keep holding on expecting you to stay
When you're all alone and if you're feeling down
I'll be, I'll be around

[Chorus]
Whenever you need somebody
I'll bring my love to you
You don't have to say you love me
I just wanna be with you1Embed

Wanna stay inside my dreams

Cry For Help LyricsShe's taken my time
Convinced me she's fine
But when she leaves
I'm not so sure

It's always the same
She's playing her game
And when she goes
I feel to blame

Why won't she say she needs me?
I know she's not as strong as she seems

Why don't I see her cry for help?
Why don't I feel her cry for help?
Why don't I hear her cry for help?

I wandered around
The streets of this town
Trying to find sense in it all

The rain on my face
It covers the trace
Of all the tears
I've had to waste
Why must we hide emotions?
Why must we never break down and cry?

All that I need is to cry for help
Somebody please hear me cry for help
All I can do is cry for help

No need to feel ashamed
Release the pain
Cry for help

Cry for help
Is all I need
All I need
Is a cry for help

Cry for help
Is all I need
All I need
Is a cry for help

Why must we hide emotions?
Why can't we ever break down and cry?

All that I need is to cry for help
I will be there when you cry for help
Why don't I hear her cry for help?
All that I need is to cry for help
Somebody please hear me cry for help
All I can do is cry for help

All that I need is to cry for help
I will be there when you cry for help
Is it so hard to cry for help?

(Cry for help is all I need)
No need to feel ashamed
(All I need is a cry for help)
Come on and release the pain
(Cry for help is all I need)
Put your trust in me
(All I need is a cry for help)
My love is gonna set you freeEmbed

Try Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't know if I can make it
But I'm gonna try, I'm gonna try
I don't know if I can make it
But just watch me try, watch me try

[Pre-Chorus]
When it feels like all my chances
End in empty sighs
I remember that the only thing
That I can lose is pride

[Chorus]
You know I got to try
Even though my heart is on the line
Even if I'm broken on the inside
There's nothing I won't do to make it right
You know, you know I got to try

[Verse 2]
All I know is nothing certain
So I'm gonna try, I'm gonna try
It's only myself that I'm hurting
If I don't try, if I don't try

[Pre-Chorus]
When it feels like all my hopes and dreams
Are shattered into dust
I remember that the only thing
I have to do is trust
[Chorus]
And you know I got to try
Even though my heart is on the line
And even if I'm broken on the inside
There's nothing I won't do to make it right
You know, you know I got to try

Even if I'm stopped at every turn
Even if I lose and crash and burn
I won't quit until your love I've earned
You know, you know I got to try

[Bridge]
Don't need anyone to tell us this is golden
I can see that there are diamonds in your eyes tonight
Don't need anyone to tell us to be open
We'll open up, we'll open up our wings and fly

[Chorus]
Even though our hearts are on the line
Even if we're broken on the inside
There's nothing we won't do to win this fight
You know, you know we got to try

Even if we're stopped at every turn
Even if we lose and crash and burn
We won't quit until our love we've earned
You know, you know we got to tryEmbed

I Can’t Help Falling in Love (With You) LyricsWise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you

Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin
If I can't help falling in love with you?

Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Somethings are meant to be

Take my hand
Take my whole life , too
For I can't help falling in love with you

Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Somethings are meant to be

Take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you
For I can't help falling in love with youEmbed
