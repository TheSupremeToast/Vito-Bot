Baby, It’s Cold Outside Lyrics[Verse 1: Marilyn Maxwell & Dean Martin]
I really can't stay (But, baby, it's cold outside)
I've got to go away (But, baby, it's cold outside)
This evening has been (Been hoping that you'd drop in)
So very nice (I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice)
My mother will start to worry (Beautiful, what's your hurry?)
My father will be pacing the floor (Listen to the fireplace roar)
So, really, I'd better scurry (Beautiful, please don't hurry)
But maybe just a half a drink more (Put some records on while I pour)
The neighbors might think (Baby, it's bad out there)
Say, what's in this drink? (No cab's to be had out there)
I wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To break this spell (I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)
I ought to say, "No, no, no, sir" (Mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (What's the sense of hurtin' my pride?)

[Chorus: Marilyn Maxwell, Dean Martin & Both]
I really can't stay
(Oh, baby, don't hold out)
Baby, it's cold outside

[Verse 2: Marilyn Maxwell & Dean Martin]
I simply must go (But, baby, it's cold outside)
The answer is no (But, baby, it's cold outside)
Your welcome has been (How lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (Look out the window at the storm)
My sister will be suspicious (Gosh your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (Waves upon the tropical shore)
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious (Gosh your lips are delicious)
But maybe just a cigarette more (Never such a blizzard before)
I've gotta get home (But, baby, you'd freeze out there)
Say, lend me a coat (It's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand (I thrill when you touch my hand)
But don't you see? (How can you do this thing to me?)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Think of my lifelong sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied (If you got pneumonia and died)
[Chorus: Marilyn Maxwell, Dean Martin & Both]
I really can't stay
(Get over that cold out)
Baby, it's cold
Baby, it's cold outside5Embed

That’s Amore Lyrics[Intro: Choir]
(In Napoli where love is king)
(When boy meets girl)
(Here's what they say)

[Chorus: Dean Martin]
When the moon hits your eye
Like a big pizza pie, that's amore
When the world seems to shine
Like you've had too much wine, that's amore

[Bridge: Dean Martin]
Bells will ring, ting-a-ling-a-ling
Ting-a-ling-a-ling and you'll sing, "Vita bella"
Hearts will play tippy-tippy-tay
Tippy-tippy-tay like a gay tarantella

[Verse: Dean Martin]
When the stars make you drool
Just like a pasta e fasule, that's amore
When you dance down the street
With a cloud at your feet, you're in love

When you walk in a dream
But you know, you're not dreaming, signore
Scusami, but you see
Back in old Napoli, that's amore
[Chorus: (Choir) & Dean Martin]
(When the moon hits your eye)
(Like a big pizza pie, that's amore) That's amore
(When the world seems to shine)
(Like you've had too much wine, that's amore) That's amore

[Bridge: (Choir) & Dean Martin]
(Bells will ring ting-a-ling-a-ling)
(Ting-a-ling-a-ling and you'll sing, "Vita bella, vita bella, vita bella")
(Hearts will play tippy-tippy-tay)
(Tippy-tippy-tay like a gay tarantella) Lucky fella

[Verse: Dean Martin & Choir]
When the stars make you drool
Just like a pasta e fasule, that's amore (That's amore)
When you dance down the street
With a cloud at your feet, you're in love

When you walk in a dream
But you know, you're not dreaming, signore
Scusami, but you see
Back in old Napoli, that's amore

[Outro: Dean Martin]

Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

[Verse 2]
Man, it doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought me some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow

[Bridge]
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

[Verse 3]
And the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbyeing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, and snow

[Bridge]
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really grab me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
[Verse 4]
Oh, the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbyeing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow4Embed

Volare (Nel Blu Di Pinto Di Blu) LyricsVolare, oh oh
Cantare, oh oh oh oh
Let's fly way up to the clouds
Away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather, a rainbow together we'll find

Volare, oh oh
E cantare, oh oh oh oh
No wonder my happy heart sings
Your love has given me wings
Penso che un sogno cosi non ritorni mai più
Mi dipingevo le mani e la faccia di blu
Poi d'improvviso venivo dal vento rapito
E incominciavo a volare nel cielo infinito
Volare, oh oh
E cantare, oh oh oh oh
Nel blu, dipinto di blu
Felice di stare lassù
E volavo, volavo felice piu in alto del sole ed ancora piu sù
Mentre il mondo pian piano spariva lontano laggiù
Una musica dolce suonava soltanto per me
Volare, oh oh
E cantare, oh oh oh oh
No wonder my happy heart sings
Your love has given me wings
Nel blu, dipinto di blu
Felice di stare lassù1Embed

Sway LyricsWhen marimba rhythms start to play
Dance with me, make me sway
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close, sway me more

Like a flower petal in the breeze
Bend with me, sway with ease
When we dance you have a way with me
Stay with me, sway with me

Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have the magic technique
When we sway I go weak

I can hear the sound of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now

Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have the magic technique
When we sway I go weak

I can hear the sound of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now
You know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now4Embed

Everybody Loves Somebody Sometimes LyricsEverybody loves somebody sometime
Everybody falls in love somehow
Something in your kiss just told me
My sometime is now

Everybody finds somebody someplace
There's no telling where love may appear
Something in my heart keeps saying
My someplace is here

If I had it in my power
I'd arrange for every girl to have your charms
Then every minute, every hour
Every boy would find what I found in your arms

Everybody loves somebody sometime
And although my dreams were overdue
Your love made it well worth waiting
For someone like you

If I had it in my power
I would arrange for every girl to have your charms
Then every minute, every hour
Every boy would find what I found in your arms

Everybody loves somebody sometime
And although my dreams were overdue
Your love made it well worth waiting
For someone like you
Everybody loves somebody sometime2Embed

Mambo Italiano LyricsA boy went back to Napoli
Because he missed the scenery
The native dances and the charming songs
But wait a minute
Somethings wrong!

All you Calabrese do the mambo like-a crazy with the
Hey mambo don't wanna tarantella, hey mambo no more mozzarella

Hey goomba I love how you dance the rumba
But take some advice paisano learn-a how to mambo

Ain’t That a Kick in the Head Lyrics[Verse 1]
How lucky can one guy be
I kissed her and she kissed me
Like the fella once said, "Ain't that a kick in the head?"

[Verse 2]
The room was completely black
I hugged her and she hugged back
Like the sailor said, quote, "Ain't that a hole in the boat"

[Chorus]
My head keeps spinning
I go to sleep and keep grinning
If this is just the beginning
My life is gonna be beautiful

[Verse 3]
I've sunshine enough to spread
It's just like the fella said
Tell me quick ain't love like a kick in the head?

[Bridge]
Like the fella once said, “Ain't love like a kick in the head?”
Like the sailor said, quote, "Ain't that a hole in the boat?"

[Chorus]
My head keeps spinning
I go to sleep and keep grinning
If this is just the beginning
My life is gonna be beautiful
[Outro]
She's telling me we'll be wed
She's picked out a king size bed
I couldn't feel any better or I'd be sick
Tell me quick, oh, ain't love a kick?
Tell me quick, ain't love a kick in the head?10Embed

On An Evening in Roma Lyrics[Refrain 1]
Como e' bella ce' la luna brille e' strette
Strette como e' tutta bella a passeggiare
Sotto il cielo di Roma

[Verse 1]
Down each avenue or via, street or strata
You can see 'em disappearing two by two
On an evening in Roma
Do they take 'em for espresso?
Yeah, I guess so
On each lover's arm, a girl I wish I knew
On an evening in Roma

[Verse 2]
Though there's grinning and mandolining in sunny Italy
The beginning has just begun when the sun goes down

[Verse 3]
So please meet me in the plaza near your casa
I am only one and that's one too few
On an evening in Roma

[Refrain 2]
Don't know what the country's coming to
But in Rome, do as the Romans do
Will you, on an evening in Roma?
[Refrain 1]
Como e' bella ce' la luna brille e' strette
Strette como e' tutta bella a passeggiare
Sotto il cielo di Roma

[Refrain 2]
Don't know what the country's coming to
But in Rome, do as the Romans do
Will you, on an evening in Roma?

Side by Side LyricsOh, we ain't got a barrel of money
Maybe we're ragged and funny
But we'll travel along singing a song
Side by side

Don't know what's coming tomorrow
Maybe it's trouble and sorrow
But we'll travel the road sharin' our load
Side by side

Through all kind of weather
What if the sky should fall
As long as we're together
It doesn't matter at all

When they've all had their quarrels and parted
We'll be the same as we started
Just to travel along singing a song
Side by side

When they've all had their quarrels and parted
We'll be the same as we started
Just to travel along singing a song
Side by side

(Side by side...)Embed
