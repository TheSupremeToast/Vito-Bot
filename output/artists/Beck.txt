Loser Lyrics[Verse 1]
In the time of chimpanzees, I was a monkey
Butane in my veins, and I'm out to cut the junkie
With the plastic eyeballs, spray paint the vegetables
Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with the loser in the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the loveseat
Someone came, saying I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps and burning down the trailer park
Yo, cut it

[Chorus]
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Double barrel buckshot)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?

[Verse 2]
The forces of evil in a bozo nightmare
Ban all the music with the phony gas chamber
'Cause one's got a weasel, and the other's got a flag
One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag
With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey neck, and it's hanging from a pigeon wing
You can't write if you can't relate
Trade the cash for the beat, for the body, for the heat
And my time is a piece of wax falling on a termite
Who's choking on the splinters
[Chorus]
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Get crazy with the cheese whiz)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Drive-by body pierce)

[Bridge]
(Yo, bring it on down)
I'm a driver, I'm a winner
Things are gonna change, I can feel it

[Chorus]
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(I can't believe you)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Sprechen Sie Deutsch, eh, baby?)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?

Dreams Lyrics[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, ah, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Come on out of your dreams
And wake up from your rêverie
Time is here, don't go to sleep
Streets are running on the brink
They say that we've got nothing
But a dollar for a life of sin
'Cause there's trouble on the way
Oh, there's trouble on the way
Oh oh, get a dog and pony for a judgment day

[Pre-Chorus]
Here we are (oh oh oh)
Running circles, around around around around (oh oh oh)
When nothing's right, just close your eyes
Close your eyes and you're gone

Dreams (dreams, dreams)
D-d-d-dreams (oh oh oh)
She's makin' me high, she's makin' me high
Dreams (dreams, dreams)
D-d-d-dreams (oh oh oh)
She's makin' me high, I wanna get me free
Nothing gonna get me in my world
[Verse 2]
Now can these broken wings free me
About a light-year from reality
If you want to fall in a dream
You could put the weight right onto me

[Pre-Chorus]
Here we are (oh oh oh)
Running circles, around around around around
When nothing's right, just close your eyes
Close your eyes and you're gone

Dreams (dreams, dreams)

She's makin' me high, she's makin' me high

Nothing gonna get me in my world
Nothing gonna get me in my world

[Bridge]
Ahh, stop fucking with my dreams, dreams, yeah
Ahh, stop fucking with my dreams, dreams, yeah
Ahh

Here we are (oh oh oh)
Running circles, around around around around
When nothing's right, just close your eyes
Close your eyes and you're gone

Nothing gonna get me in my world

Oh, oh, oh, ah, oh, oh
I wanna get me free
Nothing gonna get me in my world

Sexx Laws Lyrics[Verse 1]
Can't you hear those cavalry drums
Hijacking your equilibrium?
Midnight snacks in the mausoleum
Where the pixilated doctors moan

Carnivores in the Kowloon night
Breathing freon by the candlelight
Coquettes bitch slap you so polite
Till you thank them for the tea and sympathy

[Chorus]
I want to defy
The logic of all sex laws
Let the handcuffs slip off your wrists
I'll let you be my chaperone
At the halfway home
I'm a full-grown man
But I'm not afraid to cry

[Verse 2]
Neptune's lips taste like fermented wine
Perfumed blokes on the Ginza line
Running buck wild like a concubine
Whose mother never held her hand
Brief encounters in Mercedes Benz
Wearing hepatitis contact lens
Bed and breakfast getaway weekends
With Sports Illustrated moms

[Chorus]
I want to defy
The logic of all sex laws
Let the handcuffs slip off your wrists
I'll let you be my chaperone
At the halfway home
I'm a full-grown man
But I'm not afraid to cry5Embed

Wow Lyrics[Intro]
Giddy up, giddy up
Giddy up
Giddy up, giddy up

[Verse 1]
Wanna move into a fool's gold room
With my pulse on the animal jewels
Of the rules that you choose to use to get loose
With the luminous moves
Bored of these limits, let me get, let me get it like—

[Chorus]
—wow!
It's like, right now
It's like, wow!
It's like, right—
—right now
It's like, wow!
It's like, right now
It's like, wow!
It's like, right now
Oh, wow!

[Verse 2]
It's my life, your life
Live it once, can't live it twice
So nice, so nice
Smooth like a tidal wave, take you on a getaway
My friends, your friends
Livin' every day like it's just about to end
Now we're pissin' in the wind 'cause it's so pine fresh
Right now
Yeah I, I wanna get it like—
[Chorus]
—wow!
It's like, right now
It's like, wow!
It's like—
(Giddy up)
—wow!
It's like, right now
Wow!
Wow!
Oh, wow, it's like, right now

[Verse 3]
It's your life
Falling like a hot knife
Call your wife; secular times, these times
My demon's on the cell phone
To your demons, nothing's even right or wrong
It's irrelevant, elephant in the room goes, "Boom,"
Standing on the lawn doin' jiu jitsu
Girl in a bikini with the Lamborghini shih tzu

[Bridge]
It's your life
You gotta try to get it right
Look around, don't forget where you came from
It's just another perfect night
We're gonna take it around the world
(Wow!)
We're gonna take it around the world
(Wow!)
Ride these wild horses
(Wow!)
Ride these wild horses
(Wow!)
We're gonna take it around the world

Giddy up, giddy up

Blue Moon LyricsI'm so tired of being alone
These penitent walls are all I've known
The songbird calling
Across the water
Outside my silent asylum
Oh, don't leave me on my own
Left me standing all alone

[Refrain]
So cut me down to size
So I can fit inside
Lies that will divide
Us both in time

See the turncoat on his knees
The vagabond that no one sees
When that moon stole your shadows
When you can't save the ones you caught in battle
Oh, don't leave me on my own
Left me standing all alone
Cut me down to size
So I can fit inside
Lies you tried to hide
Behind your eyes
Don't leave me on my own
Don't leave me on my own

[Refrain]
So cut me down to size
So I can fit inside
Lies that will divide
Us both in time30Embed

Girl Lyrics[Verse 1]
I saw her, yeah I saw her with her black tongue tied
Round the roses
Fist pounding on a vending machine
Toy diamond ring stuck on her finger
With a noose she can hang from the sun
And put it out with her dark sunglasses
Walking crooked down the beach
She spits on the sand where their bones are bleaching

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
She doesn't even know what's wrong
And I know I'm gonna make her die
Take her where her soul belongs
And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
Nothing that I wouldn't try

[Chorus]
Hey, my sun-eyed girl
Hey, my sun-eyed girl
My sun-eyed girl
Hey, my sun-eyed girl

[Verse 2]
I saw her, yeah I saw her with her hands tied back
And her rags were burning
Crawling out from a landfilled life
Scrawling her name upon the ceiling
Throw a coin in a fountain of dust
White noise, her ears are ringing
Got a ticket for a midnight hanging
Throw a bullet from a freight train leaving
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
She doesn't even know what's wrong
And I know I'm gonna make her die
Take her where her soul belongs
And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
Nothing that I wouldn't try

[Chorus]
Hey, my sun-eyed girl
Hey, my sun-eyed girl
My sun-eyed girl
Hey, my sun-eyed girl

Up All Night Lyrics[Verse 1]
When you get the rhythm and words all make you cold
When they break it down and this world is all you know
Hands up, you're working it 'round
Now get yourself together
When you call the dominoes fall, it's time to go

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm feeling so far away
I see the colors and all the kids going home
Night is crawling up to the day
I hear the noise ringing
The sirens all singing

[Chorus]
Just wanna stay up all night with you
Just wanna stay up all night with you
There's nothing that I wouldn't rather do
Just wanna stay up all night with you

[Post-Chorus]
Keep on moving
Don't wait for nothing now
Keep on moving
Don't wait for nothing now
Oh, keep on moving
Don't wait, don't wait for nothing now
Oh, keep on moving
Don't wait for nothing now, nothing now
[Verse 2]
One, two, what you doing?
I been jumping through some hoops
Wanna get my body loose
Wanna tell you, tell you what to do
I been running out of bounds like an animal struggling
Looking for a diamond
I'm trying, I'm fighting
Right into the rhythm now

[Bridge]
I just wanna stay up all night
Wanna stay up all night with you
With you, you

[Chorus]
Just wanna stay up all night with you (wanna stay up all night)
Just wanna stay up all night with you
There's nothing that I wouldn't rather do (than stay up all night)
Just wanna stay up all night with you

[Outro]
Put it up in the air
If you don't really care
Let them know that you're there
If you got the time to take it up there
Hands up in the air
Living out on a prayer
Let them know that you're there
If you got the time to take it up there
Up all night with you
With you, with you5Embed

Morning Lyrics[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning
From a long night in the storm
Looked up this morning
Saw the roses full of thorns
Mountains are falling
They don't have nowhere to go
The ocean's a diamond
That only shines when you're alone
[Hook 1]
But can we start it all over again?
This morning
I've lost all my defenses
This morning
Won't you show me the way
It used to be?

[Verse 2]
We've gone all around
'Til there's nothing left to say
We've worn it all down
Into something that couldn't be saved
You tore it all down
And bury me underneath the weight
[Hook 2]
But can we start it all over again?
This morning
I let down my defenses
This morning
It was just you and me
This morning
I've run all out of guesses
This morning
Won't you show me the way
It could've been?13Embed

Debra Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ah yeah, come on
I met you at JC Penney's
I think your name tag said Jenny!
I cold-step to you with a fresh pack of gum
Somehow I knew you were looking for some. . .oh no!
Like a fruit that's ripe for the picking
I wouldn't do you like that Zankou Chicken
Cause only you got a thing that I just got to get with
I just got to get, get with you, and you know what we're gonna do

I wanna get with you, oh girl
And your sister
I think her name is Debra

And your sister
I think her name is Debra, oh!

Oh girl, I only wanna be down with you
Cause you got something that I just got to get with
I pick you up late at night after work
I said, "Lady, step inside my Hyundai
I'm gonna take you up to Glendale
Yeah, gonna take you for a real good meal."
Cause when our eyes did meet
Girl, you knew I was packing heat
Ain't no use in wasting no time gettin' to know each other
You know the deal!
Cause only you've got a thing
That I just got to get with
(got to get with!)
I just got to get with you girl, and you know
