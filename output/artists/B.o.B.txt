Headband Lyrics[Intro: B.o.B]
Mustard the beat, ho (Yeah, Bandz)

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Already got one rolled up in my left hand (In my left hand)
Pussy on my mind, tighter than a headband (Than a headband)
Kush in my lungs, got ganja in my sweat glands (In my sweat glands)
This shit I'm on, better than the next strand (Ayy)
Than the next strand, better than the next strand (Ayy)
She head down, booty poppin' in a handstand (Bandz)
I shine bright, I'll give your girl a slight tan (Woo)
I make that pussy whistle like the Old Spice man *Whistles*
I don't even understand, why she'd ever want a man
If she ever throw it, I'd catch it like a cornerback (Like a cornerback)
Like a cornerback, that's an interception (Interception)
You think I give a fuck? That's a misconception

[Refrain 1: B.o.B]
Oh, what a night (Yeah,) oh, what a night (Yeah)
The roof is on fire (Yeah,) so what? I'm high (Yeah)
I said, oh, what a night (Hey,) oh, what a night (Hey)
Yeah, she a bad bitch, all jokes aside (Woo)

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Hey, look at baby over there (Over there)
Wassup, lil mama, come here (Come here)
She started talking but I really couldn't hear (Ha)
Until she started dancing like she do it in the mirror (Oh-oh)
Uh, like she do it in the mirror (Do it in the mirror)
Uh, like she do it in the mirror (Oh-oh)
She broke it down started moving like Shakira
Uh, like she do it in the mirror
[Post-Chorus: B.o.B, 2 Chainz]
I chop one, chop two, chop that ass down (Down)
Chop that ass down, chop chop that ass down
All I want you to do is just drop that ass down (Yeah)
Drop drop that ass down, uh, now look back at it (2 Chainz)

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Whistling Dixie
Middle school, I was getting head on a ten-speed
Gigolo bloodline, pimpin' hereditary
Black on 28's, it remind of February
Day you can fuck with me, that would be Neveruary
Dead ass rapper should'a came with a cemetery
I am so cold, nigga like Ben & Jerry
Fill a nigga, deal a nigga, kill a nigga, obituary (Tell 'em)
My vision blurry, these bitches flirtin'
I been drinking all night, I think my kidney's hurtin' (Damn)
So I closed the curtains on the 62
Her ass'll knock your ass out, you better stick and move (True)
Chain hang to my ding-a-ling (What?)
Chain hang, chain hang to my ding-a-ling (Yeah)
To do a threesome you gotta intervene
Her legs so sexy when I'm in-between

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Hey, look at baby over there (Over there)
Wassup, lil mama, come here (Come here)
She started talking but I really couldn't hear (Ha)
Until she started dancing like she do it in the mirror (Oh-oh)
Uh, like she do it in the mirror (Do it in the mirror)
Uh, like she do it in the mirror (Oh-oh)
She broke it down started moving like Shakira
Uh, like she do it in the mirror
[Post-Chorus: B.o.B]
I chop one, chop two, chop that ass down (Down)
Chop that ass down, chop chop that ass down
All I want you to do is just drop that ass down
Drop drop that ass down, uh, now look back at it

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
She do it like she do it in the mirror
Be cautious, that booty is bigger than it appears
She speed it up or slow it down, like she's switching gears
I'm looking for the baddest one here, I tell her like
Do that there, do that there
You gotta stretch it out, girl, move that there
She bend it over, touch her toes when she toot that there
Like hut one, hut two, girl, who back there?
Who back there? I'm back there
I could take a step back and sip my cognac there
Picture perfect body, that's a Kodak there
Now make a nigga feel welcome like a doormat's there, I'm like

[Refrain 2: B.o.B]
Oh, what a night, oh, what a night
The roof is on fire, so what? I'm high
I'm like, oh, what a night, oh—oh, what a night
That's a bad bitch, all jokes aside, there she go (Woo)
[Chorus: B.o.B]
Hey, look at baby over there (Over there)
Wassup, lil mama, come here (Come here)
She started talking but I really couldn't hear (Ha)
Until she started dancing like she do it in the mirror (Oh-oh)
Uh, like she do it in the mirror (Do it in the mirror)
Uh, like she do it in the mirror (Oh-oh)

Airplanes Lyrics[Intro: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Yeah, I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'
And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you starin' at that phone in your lap
And you hopin' but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel in the sand
What would you wish for if you had one chance?
So airplane, airplane, sorry I'm late
I'm on my way, so don't close that gate
If I don't make that, then I'll switch my flight
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night
[Chorus: Hayley Williams, B.o.B, Both]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars? (shooting stars)
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars? (shooting stars)
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Yeah, yeah, somebody take me back to the days
Before this was a job, before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
Yeah, back when I was tryna get a tip at Subway
And back when I was rappin' for the hell of it
But nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant
I'm guessin' that if we can make some wishes out of airplanes
Then maybe, oh maybe, I'll go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for Decatur—what's up, Bobby Ray?
So can I get a wish to end the politics?
And get back to the music that started this shit?
So here I stand and then again I say
I'm hopin' we can make some wishes out of airplanes
[Chorus: Hayley Williams, B.o.B, Both]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars? (shooting stars)
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars? (shooting stars)
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Outro: B.o.B, Hayley Williams]
I could really use a wish right now (Woah-oh-oh-oh)
I, I, I could really use a wish right now (Mmm-mm-mm-mm)
Like, like, like shooting stars (Ahh-ah-ah-ah)
I, I, I could really use a wish right now (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
A wish, a wish right now90Embed

We Still In This Bitch Lyrics[Chorus: B.o.B]
I'm in my zone, I'm feeling it
Stop blowing my buzz, quit killing it
So buy another round
They tried to shut us down about an hour ago
But we still in this bitch
Turn this shit up loud
And buy another round
They tried to shut us down about an hour ago
But we still in this bitch

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
I pull up, pull up, pull up in that automatic cookup
B Rich pull up in that rooster 'til we wake the fucking hood up
Got all these pounds of ganja, I work out, I'm doing kushups
Bobby Bands is in the building, pop that pussy throw a foot up
In the air, one time for a nigga like me with a squad like this
With a team so strong with a flow so cold, ain't nothing but some bad bitches in my clique
What's up Eastside
We in this bitch
They think they seeing me
But they ain't seen shit
Girls on the pole yeah they make me rich
Girls at my shows wanna take my pic
Yeah we can do this here all night, can't tell me nothing, can't tell me shit
All in my zone, all on my own
Open that pack, rollin' that strong
And we still up in this bitch, won't turn down, won't go home
[Chorus: B.o.B]
I'm in my zone I'm feeling it

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I got big wheels on my ride, spent about six mills on my ride
You catch me swervin' all on your side of town bumpin' "Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe"
Don't blow my high, just blow my cock, I'm so paid, I'm so fly
Your baby daddy disrespect me, black his eye, that's no lie
I'm on my square, blowing circles in the air, of that purple
I'm a boss and you a worker, listen here boy don't make me hurt you
You want trouble I got plenty, how you want it full or semi
I'm so rich so all that fuckboy shit you kickin' don't offend me
Don't get killed off in this bitch, I spent mills all on this shit
Boy it's been 11 years of this shit, look at me now still in this bitch
I stand tall no can fall, you pussy ass niggas can't touch a G
See me don't speak ain't' nothing G, I'm in my zone nigga don't fuck with me
[Chorus: B.o.B]
I'm in my zone I'm feeling it
Stop blowing my buzz quit killing it
So buy another round
They tried to shut us down
About an hour ago
But we still in this bitch
Turn this shit up loud
And buy another round
They tried to shut us down
About an hour ago
But we still in this bitch

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Juicy J stay in the club, me and all my niggas
All these bad bitches, all this free liquor
Surrounded by so many women one of these hoes might be your wife
She lookin' for a nigga that's ballin' so tonight might be her night
You know me I stay stuntin', lowkey I threw tuition at Onyx
Flip money fast like Sonic, rich nigga I speak ebonics
Got a new car I paid cash, got a new crib with a weed lab
Crisp bills I need that, fuck your team where the freaks at
Hundred deep in V.I.P., niggas always hatin'
I came in with a bunch of goons and I'm leavin' with out with his lady
I got your boo in my Bugatti, she bout to swallow my babies
My system loud my weed loud, no hair clippers I'm faded
[Chorus: B.o.B]
I'm in my zone I'm feeling it
Stop blowing my buzz quit killing it
So buy another round
They tried to shut us down
About an hour ago
But we still in this bitch
Turn this shit up loud
And buy another round
They tried to shut us down
About an hour ago

Airplanes, Pt. 2 Lyrics[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Post-Chorus: B.o.B]
Dreaming… of falling
Dreaming… of falling

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Yeah, let's pretend like it's '98
Like I'm eatin' lunch off of Styrofoam trays
Tryin' to be the next rapper comin' out the A (A-Town)
Hopin' for a record deal to ignore my pain
Yeah, now let's pretend like I'm on the stage
And when my beat drops everybody goes insane
Okay, and everybody know my name (Bob)
And everywhere I go people wanna hear me sang
Oh yeah, and I just dropped my new album
On the first week I did 500 thousand
Gold in the spring, and diamond in the fall
And then a world tour just to top it all off
And let's pretend like they call me the greatest
Sellin' out arenas with big-ass stages
And everybody loved me and no one ever hated
Let's try to use imagination
[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Okay, let's pretend like this never happened (Never)
Like I never had dreams of bein' a rapper (Rapper)
Like I didn't write raps up in all of my classes (Classes)
Like I never used to run away into the blackness (Yeah)
Now, let's pretend like it was all good (Good)
Like I didn't live starin' in the notebook (Notebook)
Like I did the things that I probably knew I should (Should)
But I ain't have neighbors, that's why they call it hood (hood)
Yeah, now let's pretend like I ain't got a name (No)
Before they ever called me B.o.B or a.k.a. Bobby Ray
I'm talkin' back before the mixtapes (Cloud 9)
Before the videos and the deals and the fame (Yeah)
Before they ever once compared me to André (Three stacks)
Before I ever got on MySpace (Yeah)
Before they ever noticed my face (Yeah)
So let's just pretend and make wishes outta airplanes
[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Bridge: B.o.B. & Eminem]
And it seems like yesterday it was just a dream
But those days are gone
They're just memories
And it seems like yesterday it was just a dream
But those days are gone
All right…
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Let's pretend Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen
Let's pretend things woulda been no different
Pretend he procrastinated, had no motivation
Pretend he just made excuses that were so paper thin
They could blow away with the wind
"Marshall, you're never gonna make it
Makes no sense to play the game
There ain't no way that you'll win."
Pretend he just stayed outside all day and played with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasn't time to move and schools weren't changin' again
He wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
And he never dreamed he could rip stadiums and just lazy as shit
"Fuck a talent show in the gymnasium, bitch!"
"You won't amount to shit—quit daydreamin', kid!"
"You need to get your cranium checked."
"You're thinking like an alien, it just ain't realistic."
Now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this shit
And there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed at
And his alarm went off to wake him, but he didn't make it
To the Rap Olympics, slept through his plane and he missed it
He's gon' have a hard time explaining to Hailie and Lainey
These food stamps and this WIC shit
‘Cause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it
But it didn't fall in his lap, so he ain't even here, he pretends that—
[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now

Out of My Mind Lyrics[Chorus: B.o.B]
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm, I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm out of my-my-my
Out of my mind-mi'-mi'-mi'-mi'
I'm out of my fucking mind
Out of my fucking mind, mind

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
I'm out of my fucking mind, gee, gee, golly, oh my
I was doing fine, once upon a time
Then my brain left and it didn't say bye
Don't look at me wrong, I'm out of my mind
Like Nostradamus and da Vinci combined
So paranoid of espionage
I'm watching my doors and checking my blinds
My brain is on vacation, they telling me
And I'm bi-polar to the severity
And I need medication, apparently
And some Electroconvulsive therapy
I am a rebel, but yes, I'm so militant
Still, I'm illegible for disabilities
I am psychotic but there is no remedy
This is not figurative, this is literally
If these niggas go dumb, I go to the mental facility
See, man, I'm so out there, I slap fives with ET
I don't need a feature
They don't want me to eat à la carte when I'm on this beat
If you feel the same as me, then you got to agree
I'm out of my mind
[Chorus: B.o.B]
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm, I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm out of my-my-my
Out of my mind-mi'-mi'-mi'-mi'
I'm out of my fucking mind
Out of my fucking mind, mind

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
What's your name? B.o.B?
So, they calling you Bob?
Stop playing, nigga, you know that I'm known for the 'Bob
Couple hit songs, got you thinking you a hearthrob
Well, this thang so good, make a nigga wanna sob (Hmm, hmm)
You don't need a feature?
Nigga, I'm the feature
You gon' be the priest, and I'ma be the preacher
You can be the He-Man, I'ma be the She-Ra
You can be the Grim, I'ma be the Reaper
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night skies
Are like shooting stars?
Well, you gon' really need a wish right now
When my goons come through and start shooting stars
You know, I'm all about shoes and cars
I'm kinda drunk off booze, Bacardi
I told Baby when I get my new advance
I'ma blow that motherfucker on a blue Bugatti
You know, I graduated summa cum laude
That's why they thinking I'm Illuminati
And matter fact, let's kiss and make-up
I'll help you escape on my blue Ducati
Hallelujah!
[Chorus: B.o.B]
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm, I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm out of my-my-my
Out of my mind-mi'-mi'-mi'-mi'
I'm out of my fucking mind
Out of my fucking mind, mind

[Interlude: B.o.B]
I'm out of it
I can't seem to come out of it
What's going on inside of my head?
It feels like I'm being John Malkovich
Ladies and gentlemen, please tone it down a bit
There is an announcement, I'd like to announce (It...)
Wait, how am I suppose to pronounce this shit?

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
I don't need a sub, I don't need a speaker
'Cause a nigga bring the noise like an onomatopoeia
Leave him in the dust, all he see is my Adidas
Na-na-na-na boo-boo, wouldn't want to be ya
Never turning back, how you think I got here?
And I'm never slowing down; fuck was that, a deer?
If you got a problem, step to the office
Matter fact, never mind, talk to the Kiosk, bi-atch
You have no idea
That's why they call me B-dot; been a maniac ever since I was knee-high
Man, I swear to God, I'ma need help
Someone call Charter; maybe call FEMA
'Cause I got to be crazy or outta my mind to have this many stamps on my VISA, vis-à-vis
[Chorus: B.o.B]
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm, I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm out of my-my-my
Out of my mind-mi'-mi'-mi'-mi'
I'm out of my fucking mind
Out of my fucking mind, mind
[Outro: B.o.B & Nicki Minaj]
Wait, if I'm here and you're there?
And I'm here and you're there? [repeats]
(If I'm there and you're here?)
And I'm here and you're there?
(If I'm there and you're here?)
And if I'm here and you're there?

Nothin’ on You Lyrics[Chorus 1: Bruno Mars & B.o.B]
Beautiful girls
All over the world
I could be chasin'
But my time would be wasted
They got nothin' on you, baby
Nothin' on you, baby
They might say hi
And I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry
About what they say
'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby
(Yeah) Nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
I know you feel where I'm comin' from
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun
On the carousel, so around I spun
With no directions, just tryna get some
Tryna chase skirts, livin' in the summer sun
And so I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly, I ended up with none

[Pre-Chorus 1: B.o.B]
There's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinkin' maybe I should get it out
And I don't wanna sound redundant, but I was wonderin'
If there was somethin' that you wanna know (That you wanna know)
But never mind that, we should let it go (We should let it go)
'Cause we don't wanna be a TV episode (TV episode)
And all the bad thoughts, just let 'em go
(Go, go, go, go)
[Chorus 2: Bruno Mars & B.o.B]
Beautiful girls
All over the world

Nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
They might say hi (Hi)
And I might say hey (Hey)
But you shouldn't worry
About what they say (Why?)
'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
Nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Hands down, there will never be another one
I been around and I never seen another one
Because your style, they ain't really got nothin' on
And you wild when you ain't got nothin' on
Baby, you the whole package, plus you pay your taxes
And you keep it real while them others stay plastic
You're my Wonder Woman, call me Mr. Fantastic
Stop, now think about it
[Pre-Chorus 2: B.o.B]
I've been to London (Yeah), I've been to Paris (Yeah)
Even way out there to Tokyo (Tokyo)
Back home down in Georgia (Yeah) to New Orleans (Yeah)
But you always steal the show (Steal the show)
And just like that, girl, you got me froze (Got me froze)
Like a Nintendo 64 (64)
If you never knew, well, now you know
(Know, know, know, know)

[Chorus 2: Bruno Mars & B.o.B]
Beautiful girls
All over the world
I could be chasin'
But my time would be wasted (Ha-ha)
They got nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
Nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you

And I might say hey (Hey)
But you shouldn't worry
About what they say (Why?)
'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
Nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
[Bridge: B.o.B]
Everywhere I go
I'm always hearin' your name
And no matter where I'm at
Girl, you make me wanna sing
Whether a bus or a plane
Or a car or a train
No other girl's in my brain
And you the one to blame

[Chorus 2: Bruno Mars & B.o.B]
Beautiful girls
All over the world
I could be chasin'
But my time would be wasted (Why?)
They got nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
Nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
They might say hi (Hi)

But you shouldn't worry
About what they say (Why?)

Magic Lyrics[Intro: B.o.B]
Hi, my name is B.o.B, and I approve this message

[Hook: Rivers Cuomo]
I got the magic in me
Every time I touch that track it turns into gold
Everybody knows I got the magic in me
When I hit the floor, the girls come snappin' at me
Now everybody wants some presto magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Ahooooooo, I got the magic in me

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
These tricks that I'll attempt will blow your mind
Pick a verse, any verse, I'll hypnotize you with every line (Ah!)
I'll need a volunteer, how about you, with the eyes? (Right there)
Come on down to the front and stand right here and don't be shy (Bobby)
I'll have you time travellin', have your mind babblin'
People tryin' to inherit the skill, so they askin' me
Even David Blaine had to go and take some classes and
I see Mindfreak like "What's up man, what's happenin'?" (Mindfreak!)
So come one, come all, and see the show tonight (Ha)
Prepare to be astounded, no ghost or poltergeist
You know I'm no Pinocchio, I never told a lie
So call me Mr. Magic Man, I float on Cloud 9, haha
[Hook: Rivers Cuomo & B.o.B]
I got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
Every time I touch that track it turns into gold (Yes, it turns to gold)
Everybody knows I got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
When I hit the floor, the girls come snappin' at me (They be snappin', baby)
Now everybody wants some presto magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Ahooooooo, I got the magic in me

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
We'll take a journey into my mind, you'll see why it's venom I rhyme
Stay on the road, so I call my mama when I got time
I hit the stage, go insane, then jump into that crowd (Ah)
See, see, when I rhyme, I flow on the beat like pitta-da-da
See, I deceive ya with my intergalactic ether (Yeah)
I sing just like Aretha, so respect me like I'm Caesar
I kick it like Adidas, flowin' sticky like adhesive
Be cautious, 'cause what I be on'll leave ya with amnesia
I break all the rules like Evel Knievel (Yeah!)
It's a spectacular show, 'cause my heart pumps diesel
So whatever you sayin', it don't entertain my ego
I do this everyday, Hocus Pocus is my steelo

[Hook: Rivers Cuomo & B.o.B]
I got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
Every time I touch that track it turns into gold (Yes, it turns to gold)
Everybody knows I got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
When I hit the floor, the girls come snappin' at me (They be snappin', baby)
Now everybody wants some presto magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Ahooooooo, I got the magic in me
[Outro: B.o.B, B.o.b & Rivers Cuomo]
Ayy, that, that, I got that
Ayy, I got the magic in me
Ah-ha-ha
I, I, I, I, I got the magic in me29Embed

Strange Clouds Lyrics[Intro: B.o.B]
Yeah, eh-hahaha
Oh, you already know what we gon' do
Eh-hahaha
Hey

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Well, if you guessin' it's me, you guessed correctly
I just stay with a stallion, you would swear I was an equestrian
And um, I'ma hit her with that pipe, call that Nancy Kerrigan
Stay on the greenest greens, call us vegetarians
You be on that minor league, but we smoke professionally
I do my job exceptionally, on point like a decimal is
The way I ride on the beat, man, I beat every street
It's done so effortlessly
Yeah, so these niggas can't sleep on me
There's no Inception in this

[Refrain: B.o.B]
Bitch, I'm top chef, you top ramen, I'm top shelf
No last call to the bartender, "What you got left?"
Pour it up, don't stop there, hold your cup, take a shot, yeah
All night we celebrate 'cause we everywhere and you not there, ha

[Chorus: B.o.B, Lil Wayne]
All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out
(That's all we do, that's all we do)
And all we do is light it up all night
All you see is strange clouds (Strange clouds)
Strange clouds (Yeah)
All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out
(That's all we do, that's all we do) (Haha!)
And all we do is light it up all night (Yeah, yeah)
All you see is strange clouds (Strange clouds)
Strange clouds
[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, blue jeans, I'm faded, mining my own data
Smokin' on that strong, that Arnold Schwarzenegger
It's Tunechi Li, you bitch, you, you hot as a igloo
Kick back on that Glock, call that Jiu Jitsu
Hello world, I'm with a yellow girl, number two pencil
These rappers is washed up, spin cycle, rinse you
My nigga, all day, all night, half-pipe
I dive in that pussy, ya, I belly flop, I jack knife

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
And shit, tell my homies that I say it's a party
Yeah, got that TEC for technical difficulties
I'm top dog, you top ramen, I'm top dog
Piru, gangsters, outlaws!

[Chorus: B.o.B & Lil Wayne]
All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out (Yeah!)
(That's all we do, that's all we do) (Young Mula, baby!)
And all we do is light it up all night
All you see is strange clouds (Strange clouds)
(Hahahaha) Strange clouds
All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out (B.o.B. fuck with me!)
(That's all we do, that's all we do)
And all we do is light it up all night
All you see is strange clouds (Strange clouds)
Strange clouds, strange clouds, strange clouds
[Verse 3: B.o.B]
Well, ain't no question, yes, it's B.o.B, yes, definitely
Up in the studio, I got all my necessities
If you want that real shit, you made the right selection (Haha)
I'm Decatur 'til I die (Yeah), yes, I rep that definitely
They say I'm a celebrity, what the fuck's a celebrity?
I guess I must invest in the proper form of protection
And I say it's a curse, but it's been mostly a blessin'
To a nigga from the hood, tryin' to aim for the top
I didn't even need no directions

[Refrain: B.o.B]
I just wake up and then I roll up the purp
But these niggas wake up on my dick
At least have some breakfast first (Hey)
Nigga, keep your nourishment first
And your mind on my lyrics
'Cause what you hopin' to accomplish
I already did it, bitch!

[Chorus: B.o.B]
All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out
(That's all we do, that's all we, that's all we do, hey)
And all we do is light it up (Hey) all night
All you see is strange clouds (Hey)
(Strange clouds) Strange clouds, bitch!
All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out
(That's all we do, that's all we, that's all we do)
And all we do is light it up all night
All you see is strange clouds (All you see is, all you see)

Bombs Away Lyrics[Intro: Morgan Freeman]
As the war between light and darkness continues
Heroes and villains become harder to identify
Kindred spirits separated at birth
Fighting for their place in time to be solidified
The clock ticks faster and faster
While time runs a marathon in this Babylon
But see, the end is only the beginning
The beginning of the calm before the storm

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
I used to dream of success, now success is inadequate
It seems the bigger I get it's the more they get mad at me
Cause there ain't no rules inside this fight that we battling
And it ain't no leftover scraps, you only eat if you capture it
And I swear it's like a fucked up reality
But creation needs a devil, the devil needs an advocate
I guess, and I ain't too big on duality but
You think you know me? You ain't seen the half of me
So fly: no gravity, so high: Mount Everest
And the show must go on, yes, but I don't have to act in it
And they don't make a television that handles the frequencies
Of my channel and there ain't no computer that can hack it
It just don't have the capacity, hell nah, that ain't happening
You hustle? Well we are Grand Hustle, nigga, we mastered it
Y'all working on your bachelors, we ball like the athletes
Drink wine out of chalices on Sunday like we catholics
And if this is an embassy, consider me ambassador
Official, no artificial preservatives or additives
I love it all but I ain't attached to it
They call this a game because it is exactly
[Hook: B.o.B]
Whenever I wake up, I get this feeling
That I can't wait up, cause time is ticking
Bombs away (Bombs away)
Whenever I wake up, I get this feeling
That I can't wait up, cause time is ticking
Bombs away (Bombs away)

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
And it seems like in the grand scheme of it all
The world's run by a few people and we never seen them at all
How do they exist if we don't know who they are?
They can be you, they could be me, they could be queens and gods
Some say that we're slaves, an alien race created us all
From a distant star, some say through evolution we evolve
But if anything, what you finna see is a change, don't be alarmed
And whoever they are, well I think that it's time we start takin' charge
Fuck rules, fuck bars, you can be whatever you want
You could be a star with a car with a house made out of gold
And in the springs, on the falls, you could never see it all
If you don't know what I mean, have you seen Niagara Falls?
Man I swear this world is ours, but I've just been pushed too far
Now I be beasting up on these bars
Freak out a beat and then beat it out raw
Good God, if I go this hard, by the time I'm ninety
I won't need viagra nah, even if I had a dog
I be the canine, I'd have a ball
Better watch out when you cross my yard
I am a flame, I am the spark
I am in drive, y'all are in park
Look at my shot, look at the arc
Look at the crowd as soon as I start
Look in they eyes and look in they hearts
Two middle fingers straight at the law
Sincerely yours, so pray to your lord
Cause this is a war, ain't talkin' 'bout bullets and swords
UFOs don't make any noise
When they travel in hyper speed, so welcome aboard
[Hook: B.o.B]
Whenever I wake up, I get this feeling
That I can't wait up, cause time is ticking
Bombs away (Bombs away)
Whenever I wake up, I get this feeling
That I can't wait up, cause time is ticking
Bombs away (Bombs away)

[Outro: Morgan Freeman]
As the mask of deception falls off the face of humanity
Unveiling the grim reality of duality
In which everyone is a casualty, no one will be exempt
Truth has many shades
It's not a matter of black and white, but gray
Although many, we are one, so in the final analysis
Could it be that we are fighting a war that can't be won?29Embed

So Good Lyrics[Verse 1]
Drinking a German beer, with a Cuban cigar
In the middle of Paris with a Dominican broad
Great head on her shoulders, she probably studied abroad
She transferred to Harvard from King's College in March
She says that I'm her favorite 'cause she admires the art
Michelangelo with the flow, Picasso with the bars
She's well put together like a piece by Gershwin
Renaissance style, tonight is picture perfect, so smile
And pack your bags real good, baby
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, tell me how you feel, what's your fantasy oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my señorita
We ain't gotta rush, just take it slow
You'll be in the high life, soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want is yours
I'll have you living life like you should
You'll say you never had it so good

[Chorus]
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
You never had it so good
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
[Verse 2]
Suffering from first class cabin fever
Five hour layovers from Norway to Egypt
I'm to the point like the pyramids of Giza
Still I'm to the left like the tower out in Pisa
I'm feeling single baby, I could use a feature
Swagger like Caesar, I'll get you a visa
We can go to Italy and maybe see the Colosseum
I'll be Da Vinci if you'll be my Mona Lisa, now smile
So pack your bags real good, baby
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, tell me how you feel, what's your fantasy oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my señorita
We ain't gotta rush, just take it slow
You'll be in the high life, soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want is yours
I'll have you living life like you should
You'll say you never had it so good

[Chorus]
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
You never had it so good
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
You never had it so good
[Verse 3]
Well I been feeling singular, how 'bout let's make it plural
Spin the globe, wherever it lands that's where we'll go
We'll hit up Europe, yep, and spend some Euros
And maybe visit Berlin, the walls with the murals
This is your month baby, sign of the Virgo
Private reservations, glasses full of Merlot
A Rosé, a Burgundy, traveling like turbo
Brush up on your Español, we're Barcelona-bound, so smile
So pack your bags real good, baby
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, tell me how you feel, what's your fantasy oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my señorita
We ain't gotta rush, just take it slow
You'll be in the high life, soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want is yours
I'll have you living life like you should
You'll say you never had it so good

[Chorus]
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
You never had it so good
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
You never had it so good
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
You never had it so good
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
You never had it so good29Embed
