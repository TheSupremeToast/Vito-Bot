Painkiller Lyrics[Drum Intro]

[Verse 1]
Faster than a bullet, terrifying scream
Enraged and full of anger, he's half man and half machine
Rides the Metal Monster, breathing smoke and fire
Closing in with vengeance soaring high

[Chorus]
He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller

[Verse 2]
Planets devastated, mankind's on its knees
A saviour comes from out the skies in answer to their pleas
Through boiling clouds of thunder, blasting bolts of steel
Evil's going under deadly wheels

[Chorus]
He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
Oh!

[Bridge]
Faster than a laser bullet
Louder than an atom bomb
Chromium plated boiling metal
Brighter than a thousand suns
[Guitar Solo: Glenn Tipton]

[Verse 3]
Flying high on rapture, stronger free and brave
Nevermore encaptured, they've been brought back from the grave
With mankind resurrected, forever to survive
Returns from Armageddon to the skies

[Chorus - Extended]
He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
Wings of steel Painkiller
Deadly wheels Painkiller
Ah!

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller

Pain! Pain! Killer! Killer!
Pain! Pain! Killer! Killer!
[Guitar Solo: K.K. Downing]

[Outro]
Can't stop the painkiller!

Breaking the Law Lyrics[Verse 1]
There I was completely wasting, out of work and down
All inside it's so frustrating as I drift from town to town
Feel as though nobody cares if I live or die
So I might as well begin to put some action in my life

[Chorus]
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law

[Verse 2]
So much for the golden future, I can't even start
I've had every promise broken, there's anger in my heart
You don't know what it's like, you don't have a clue
If you did you'd find yourselves doing the same thing too

[Chorus]
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law

[Bridge]
You don't know what it's like
[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law

[Outro]
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law8Embed

You’ve Got Another Thing Comin’ Lyrics[Verse 1]
One life I'm gonna live it up
I'm takin' flight I said I'll never get enough
Stand tall I'm young and kinda proud
I'm on top as long as the music's loud

[Pre-Chorus 1]
If you think I'll sit around as the world goes by
You're thinkin' like a fool 'cause it's a case of do or die
Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had
If you think I'll let it go, you're mad
You've got another thing comin'

[Chorus]
You've got another thing comin'

[Verse 2]
That's right, here's where the talkin' ends
Well listen this night there'll be some action spent
Drive hard I'm callin' all the shots
I got an ace card comin' down on the rocks

[Pre-Chorus 2]
If you think I'll sit around while you chip away my brain
Listen I ain't foolin' and you'd better think again
Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had
If you think I'll let it go, you're mad
You've got another thing comin'
[Chorus]
You've got another thing comin'
You've got another thing comin'

[Bridge]
In this world we're livin' in, we have our share of sorrow
Answer now is don't give in, aim for a new tomorrow

[Guitar Solo]

Oh, so hot, no time to take a rest, yeah
Act tough, ain't room for second best
Real strong, got me some security
Hey, I'm a big smash, I'm goin' for infinity, yeah

[Pre-Chorus 1]
If you think I'll sit around as the world goes by
You're thinkin' like a fool 'cause it's a case of do or die
Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had
If you think I'll let it go, you're mad
You've got another thing comin'

You've got another thing comin'
You've got another thing comin'

Electric Eye Lyrics[Verse 1]
Up here in space, I’m looking down on you
My lasers trace everything you do
You think you’ve private lives, think nothing of the kind
There is no true escape, I’m watching all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean

[Chorus]
I’m elected electric spy
I’m protected electric eye

[Verse 2]
Always in focus, you can’t feel my stare
I zoom into you, but you don’t know I’m there
I take a pride in probing all your secret moves
My tearless retina takes pictures that can prove

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean
[Chorus]
I’m elected electric spy
I’m protected electric eye

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Electric eye, in the sky
Feel my stare, always there
There’s nothing you can do about it
Develop and expose
I feed upon your every thought
And so my power grows

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean

[Chorus]
I’m elected electric spy
I’m protected electric eye

[Outro]
I'm elected electric spy
I'm elected, protected, detective, electric eye8Embed

Beyond the Realms of Death Lyrics[Verse 1]
He had enough, he couldn't take anymore
He found a place in his mind and slammed the door
No matter how they tried, they couldn't understand
They washed and dressed him, fed him by hand

[Chorus]
Yeah, I've left the world behind
I am safe here in my mind
I'm free to speak with my own kind
This is my life, this is my life, I'll decide not you

[Verse 2]
Withdrawn he'd sit there, stare blank into space
No sign of life would flicker on his face
Until one day he smiled, it seemed as though with pride
The wind kissed him goodbye, and then he died

[Chorus]
Yeah, I've left the world behind
I am safe here in my mind
I'm free to speak with my own kind
This is my life, this is my life, I'll decide not you

[Verse 3]
Keep the world with all its sin
It's not fit for living in
Yeah! I will start again
It can take forever and ever and ever and ever
But I shall win
[Guitar Solo: Glenn Tipton]

[Verse 4]
How many like him are there still?
But to us, all seem to have lost the will
They lie in thousands, plagued and lost
Is nothing worth this bitter cost?

[Chorus]
Yeah, I've left the world behind
I am safe here in my mind
I'm free to speak with my own kind
This is my life, this is my life, I'll decide not you

[Bridge]
Keep the world with all its sin
It's not fit for living in

Victim of Changes Lyrics[Verse 1]
Whiskey woman, don't you know that you are drivin' me insane?
The liquor you give stems your will to live and gets right to my brain
Don't you know you're driving me insane?
You're tryin' to find your way through life
You're tryin' to get some new direction
Another woman's got her man
But she won't find no new connection

[Chorus]
Takes another drink or two
Things look better when she's through

[Verse 2]
Take another look around, you're not going anywhere
You've realized you're gettin' old and no one seems to care
You're tryin' to find your way again
You're tryin' to get some new
Another woman's got her man
But she won't get a new

[Chorus]
Takes another drink or two
Things look better when she's through

[Post-Chorus]
You've been foolin' with some hot guy
I want to know why is it why
Get up, get out, you know you really blew it
I've had enough, I've had enough, good God, pluck me
[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge 1]
Once she was wonderful
Once she was fine
Once she was beautiful
Once she was mine, she was mine
Change has come over her body
She doesn't see me anymore
Now change has come over her body
She doesn't see me anymore

[Bridge 2]

Dreamer Deceiver Lyrics[Verse 1]
Standing by my window, breathing summer breeze
Saw a figure floating, 'neath the willow tree
Asked us if we were happy, we said we didn't know
Took us by the hands and up we go

[Verse 2]
We followed the dreamer through the purple hazy clouds
He could control our sense of time
We thought we were lost but no matter how we tried
Everyone was in peace of mind

[Verse 3]
We felt the sensations drift inside our frames
Finding complete contentment there
And all the tensions that hurt us in the past
Just seemed to vanish in thin air

[Verse 4]
He said in the cosmos is a single sonic sound
That is vibrating constantly
And if we could grip and hold on to the note
We would see our minds were free, oh they're free

[Bridge]
We are lost above
Floating way up high
If you think you can find a way
You can surely try

Living After Midnight Lyrics[Chorus]
Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning
Then I'm gone, I'm gone

[Verse 1]
I took the city 'bout one A.M, loaded, loaded
I'm all geared up to score again, loaded, loaded
I come alive in the neon light
That's when I make my moves right

[Chorus]
Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning
Then I'm gone, I'm gone

[Verse 2]
Got gleaming chrome, reflecting steel, loaded, loaded
Ready to take on every deal, loaded, loaded
My pulse is racing, I'm hot to take
This motor's revved up, fit to break

[Chorus]
Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning
Then I'm gone, I'm gone
[Bridge]
I'm aiming for you
I'm gonna floor you
My body's coming
All night long

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
The air's electric, sparking power, loaded, loaded
I'm getting hotter by the hour, loaded, loaded
I set my sights and then home in
The joint starts flying when I begin

[Chorus]
Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning
Then I'm gone, I'm gone

Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning1Embed

Turbo Lover Lyrics[Verse 1]
You won't hear me, but you'll feel me
Without warning, something's dawning, listen
Then within your senses
You'll know you're defenseless
How your heart beats when you run for cover
You can't retreat, I spy like no other
Then we'll race together
We can ride forever
Wrapped in horsepower, driving into fury
Changing gear I pull you tighter to me

[Chorus]
I'm your turbo lover
Tell me there's no other
I'm your turbo lover
Better run for cover

[Verse 2]
We hold each other closer
As we shift to overdrive
And everything goes rushing by
With every nerve alive
We move so fast it seems as though
We've taken to the sky
Love machines in harmony
We hear the engines cry
[Chorus]
I'm your turbo lover
Tell me there's no other
I'm your turbo lover
Better run for cover

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
On and on we're charging
To the place so many seek
In perfect synchronicity
Of which so many speak
We feel so close to heaven
In this roaring heavy load
And then in sheer abandonment
We shatter and explode

[Chorus]
I'm your turbo lover
Tell me there's no other
I'm your turbo lover
Better run for cover
I'm your turbo lover
Tell me there's no other
I'm your turbo lover
Better run for cover7Embed

Night Crawler Lyrics[Verse 1]
Howling winds keep screaming around
And the rain comes pouring down
Doors are locked and bolted now
As the thing crawls into town

[Pre-Chorus]
Straight out of Hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you

[Chorus]
Night crawler
Beware the beast in black
Night crawler
You know he's coming back
Night crawler

[Verse 2]
Sanctuary is being sought
Whispered prayers our last resort
Homing in its cry distorts
Terror struck they know they're caught

[Pre-Chorus]
Straight out of Hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you
[Chorus]
Night crawler
Beware the beast in black
Night crawler
You know he's coming back
Night crawler

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
As night is falling
The end is drawing near
They'll hear
Their last rites echo on the wind

[Bridge]
Huddled in the cellar
Fear caught in their eyes
Daring not to move or breathe
As the creature cries
Fingernails start scratching
On the outside wall
Clawing at the windows
"Come to me" it calls
Atmosphere's electric
As it now descends the stairs
Hiding in the darkness
Is so futile from its glare
Death comes in an instant
As they hoped it would
Souls ascend to heaven
While it feasts on flesh and blood
[Pre-Chorus]
Straight out of Hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you

[Chorus]
Night crawler
Beware the beast in black
Night crawler
You know he's coming back
Night crawler

[Outro]
He's going to get you
He's going to get you
Beware of the beast
Night crawler
Beware of the beast
He's going to get you
Night crawler
Straight out of hell
Beware of the beast
He's going to get you6Embed
