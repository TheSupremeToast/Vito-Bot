Helicopter Lyrics[Verse 1]
North to south, empty
Running on bravado
As if to say, as if to say
As if to say, he doesn't like chocolate
He's born a liar, he'll die a liar
Some things will never be different

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Stop being so American
There's a time and there's a place
So James Dean, so blue jeans
Gonna save the world, he's gonna

Are you hoping for a miracle?
Are you hoping for a miracle?
Are you hoping for a miracle?

[Verse 2]
Three out of five, three out of five (It's not enough)
Six out of ten, better luck next time
Just like his dad, just like his dad (The same mistakes)
Some things will never be different
Hungry and dumb, hungry and dumb (So wait in line)
Queuing up for some more junk food
It's not my fault, it's not my fault (Just this once)
They're getting so much younger
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Why can't you be more European?
Bastard child of guilt and shame
Bury your head in the sand
I'm thinking six, six, six, I'm thinking six

[Chorus]
Are you hoping for a miracle?
Are you hoping for a miracle?
Are you hoping for a miracle?
Are you hoping for a miracle?

Are you hoping for a miracle? (It's not enough)
Are you hoping for a miracle? (It's not enough)

Are you hoping for a miracle? (It's not enough)17Embed

Banquet Lyrics[Verse 1]
A heart of stone, a smoking gun
I can give you life, I can take it away
A heart of stone, a smoking gun
I'm working it out
Why'd you feel so underrated?
Why'd you feel so negated?

[Chorus]
Turning away from the light, becoming adult
Turning into myself
I wanted to bite not destroy, to feel her underneath
Turning into the light

[Verse 2]
She don't think straight
No, no, no, she don't think straight
She's got such a dirty mind and it never ever stops
And you don't taste like her and you never ever will
And we don't read the papers, we don't read the news
Heaven's never enough, we will never be fooled

[Chorus]
Turning away from the light, becoming adult
Turning into myself
I wanted to bite not destroy, to feel her underneath
Turning into the light
[Bridge]
And if you feel (And if you feel)
A little left behind (A little left behind)
We will wait for you on the other side
And if you feel (And if you feel)
A little left behind (A little left behind)
We will wait for you on the other side

[Outro]
'Cause I'm on fire
'Cause you know I'm on fire when you come
'Cause you know I'm on fire
'Cause you know I'm on fire so stomp me out
'Cause I'm on fire
'Cause I'm on fire
'Cause I'm on fire

This Modern Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
To be lost in the forest, to be caught adrift
You've been trying to reach me, you bought me a book
To be lost in the forest, to be caught adrift
I've been paid, I've been paid
To be lost in the forest, to be caught adrift
You've been trying to reach me, you bought me a book
To be lost in the forest, to be caught adrift
I've been paid, I've been weighed, I've been

[Verse 2]
Don't get offended if I seem absent-minded
Just keep telling me facts and keep making me smile
And don't get offended if I seem absent-minded
I get tongue-tied
Baby, you've got to be more discerning
I've never known what's good for me
Baby, you've got to be more demanding
I will be yours

[Bridge]
I'll pay for you anytime
I'll pay for you anytime

[Verse 3]
And you told me you wanted to eat up my sadness
Well jump on, enjoy, you can gorge away
And you told me you wanted to eat up my sadness
(Jump right)
Baby, you've got to be more discerning
I've never known what's good for me and
Baby, you've got to be more demanding
(Jump left)
What are you holding out for?
What's always... (In the way?)
Why so damn absent-minded?
Why so scared... (Of romance?)
[Chorus]
This modern love breaks me
This modern love wastes me
This modern love breaks me
This modern love wastes me

[Outro]
Do you wanna come over and kill some time?
Do you wanna come over and kill some time?
Do you wanna come over and kill some time?

Like Eating Glass Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's so cold in this house
Open mouth swallowing us
The children sent home from school
Will not stop crying
And I know that you're busy, do I know that you care?
You got your finger on the pulse, you got your eyes everywhere
And it hurts all the time when you don't return my calls
And you haven't got the time to remember how it was
It's so cold in this house
It's so cold in this house

[Verse 2]
I can't eat, I can't sleep
I can't sleep, I can't dream
An aversion to light
Got a fear of the ocean

[Chorus]
Like drinking poison, like eating glass
Like drinking poison, like eating glass
Like drinking poison, like eating glass
Like drinking poison, like eating

[Verse 3]
It's so cold in this house
It's so cold in this house
It's so cold in this house
It's so cold in this bed
[Chorus]
Like drinking poison, like eating glass
Like drinking poison, like eating glass
Like drinking poison, like eating glass
Like drinking poison, like eating

[Bridge]
C-c-c-come and show me
How, how it was

[Outro]
We've got crosses on our eyes
Been walking into the walls again
We've got crosses on our eyes
Been walking into the furniture
We've got crosses on our eyes
For richer, for poorer, for better, for worse
We've got crosses on our eyes
We've been walking into the furniture9Embed

So Here We Are Lyrics[Verse]
I caught a glimpse
But it's been forgotten
So here we are again
I made a vow
To carry you home, home
I really tried
To be what you wanted
It all went wrong again
I made a vow
To carry you home
If you fall sick
If you pass out, out

[Bridge]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Outro]
I figured it out
I figured it out
I figured it out
I figured it out
I can see again

I can see again

The Love Within Lyrics[Verse 1]
Lord, give me grace and dancing feet
As I conquer all anxiety
The angel told me not to fear
That the power to was in me
For I have learnt the way to pray
Like a muscle growing taut now
Bind the past into a knot
And let the love consume us
Let the love consume us
Let the love consume us

[Verse 2]
Can you hear the stars now sing
Resounding in D major?
As the god vibration resonates
And pulls us up towards her
Take your shoes off, feel the earth
Beneath your feet respond to touch
And let our laughter now ring forth
As the love consumes us

[Chorus]
The love within is moving upwards
Sweeter than any drug
The melody is taking over
Guide my hand through this hurt
Pull back the veil
Let your eyes meet this world
The love within is moving upwards
So don't you want to get high?
Don't you want to get high?
[Bridge]
Don't you want to get high?
Don't you want to get-
Don't you want to get high?

[Chorus]
The love within is moving upwards
Sweeter than any drug
The melody is taking over
Guide my hand through this hurt
Pull back the veil
Let your eyes meet this world
The love within is moving upwards
So don't you want to get high?
Don't you want to get high?3Embed

Blue Light Lyrics[Verse 1]
You'll find it hiding in shadows
You'll find it hiding in cupboards
It will walk you home safe every night
It will help you remember

[Chorus]
If that's the way it is then that's the way it is
If that's the way it is then that's the way it is
If that's the way it is then that's the way it is
If that's the way it is then that's the way it is

[Verse 2]
I still feel you in the taste of cigarettes
What could I ever run to?
Just tell me it's tearing you apart
Just tell me you cannot sleep

[Chorus]
If that's the way it is then that's the way it is
If that's the way it is then that's the way it is

[Bridge]
And you didn't even notice when the sky turned blue
And you couldn't tell the difference between me and you
And I nearly didn't notice the gentlest feeling
The gentlest feeling
The gentlest feeling
The gentlest feeling

Skeleton Lyrics[Verse 1]
All my thoughts are of ice
All my thoughts are of ice
All my bones are so tired
All my bones are so tired
So young and so handsome
So easily led
They told me to wait

[Chorus]
He makes a man out of me, he makes a man out of me
He makes a man out of me, he makes a man out of me
You take the fun out of me, you take the fun out of me
You take the fun out of me, you take the fun
And I've been consistent to the fucking dream
And I've paid my dues just to get them all back
A simple man with simple desire

[Verse 2]
What should I have said?
What should I have done?
The horses are here
The damage is done
So just take off your shirt
And just take off your dress
We can go dancing
On a Saturday
[Chorus]
He makes a man out of me, he makes a man out of me
He makes a man out of me, he makes a man out of me
You take the fun out of me, you take the fun out of me
You take the fun out of me, you take the fun
And I've been consistent to the fucking dream
And I've paid my dues just to get them all back
A simple man with simple desire

I'm just a skeleton
I'm just a skeleton
I'm just a skeleton

And I've been consistent to the fucking dream
And I've paid my dues just to get them all back

Hunting for Witches Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm sitting on the roof of my house
With a shotgun
And a six pack of beers
Six pack of beers, six pack of beers

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The newscaster says "the enemy's among us"
As bombs explode on the 30 bus
Kill your middle class indecision
Now is not the time for liberal thought

[Chorus]
So I go hunting for witches
I go hunting for witches
Heads are going to roll
I go hunting for

[Verse 2]
90's, optimistic as a teen
Now it's terror
Airplanes crash into towers
Into towers, into towers

[Pre-Chorus 2]
The Daily Mail says "the enemy's among us
Taking our women and taking our jobs"
All reasonable thought is being drowned out
By the non-stop baying, baying, baying for blood
[Chorus]
So I go hunting for witches
I go hunting for witches
Heads are going to roll
I go hunting for

[Bridge]
I was an ordinary man with ordinary desires
I watched TV, it informed me
I was an ordinary man with ordinary desire
There must be accountability
Disparate and misinformed
Fear will keep us all in place

[Chorus]
So I go hunting for witches
I go hunting for witches
Heads are going to roll
I go hunting for

[Outro]
I was an ordinary man with ordinary desires
I watched TV, it informed me
I was an ordinary man with ordinary desire
There must be accountability
Disparate and misinformed
Fear will keep us all in place7Embed

Signs Lyrics[Verse 1]
Two ravens in the old oak tree
And one for you and one for me
And bluebells in the late December
I see signs now all the time
The last time we slept together
There was something that was not there
You never wanted to alarm me
But I'm the one that's drowning now

[Verse 2]
I can sleep forever these days
Cause in my dreams I see you again
But this time-fleshed out fuller face
In your confirmation dress
It was so like you to visit me
To let me know you were okay
It was so like you to visit me
You're always worried about someone else

[Bridge]
At your funeral I was so upset
So, so upset
In your life you were larger than this
Statue statuesque
[Chorus](x2)
I see signs now all the time
That you're not dead, you're sleeping
I believe in anything
That brings you back home to me3Embed
