Alien Boy Lyrics[Chorus]
I fell down to earth
From a hundred miles away, and somehow
I still make it work
But it's overrated and somehow played out

[Verse 1]
Three doors down so you can't ignore it
I'll hunt you down like a tyrannosaurus
My teeth are sharp like the great white shark
Let me taste that flesh, it's my favorite part
Got a eagle beak, with the ostrich feet
Seven spider eyes for every day of the week
Means I'm still up working while your bitch ass sleeps
I'm an alien among the human beings

[Chorus]
I fell down to earth
From a hundred miles away, and somehow
I still make it work
But it's overrated and somehow played out

[Verse 2]
Ten doors down, but you still can't see me
I talk a lot of shit so you won't believe me
I really wouldn't say anything else
I shouldn't be standing here all by myself
'Cause I'm out there
Tried to tell you that I'm out here on my own
I told you I was out there
Tried to tell you that I'm out here on my own
[Chorus]
I fell down to earth
From a hundred miles away, and somehow
I still make it work
But it's overrated and somehow played out

[Bridge]
Ah
I won't be here long at all

[Chorus]
I fell down to earth
From a hundred miles away, and somehow
I still make it work
But it's overrated and somehow played out62Embed

Hurt Lyrics[Intro]
My day will come, I gave too much
I sold my soul, I'm waiting for my pay in full
I only want your dying love, I seen enough

[Chorus]
I tried, but I don't think so
Maybe it was me who was fucking up
I gave all I could give, but
It seems like it never really was enough

[Verse 1]
I feel left out, I don't see how
My whole life can change in one week
I don't mind my own reflection
I don't see how you've been let down
Don't speak 'less you have to
Why you always seem in a bad mood?
Your whole life, you had an attitude
One day, is that so bad for you?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if it got that bad
I'm sorry I can't help you
Somebody should've had your back
[Chorus]
I tried, but I don't think so
Maybe it was me who was fucking up
I gave all I could give, but
It seems like it never really was enough

[Verse 2]
I changed my whole life when
I learned to ignore them
I changed my whole life up
Maybe it was not enough
I don't think I'm allowed to
Make a deal with your selfish ways
They're acting vicious out there
There's lots of demons out here

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if it got that bad
I'm sorry I can't help you
Somebody should've had your back

[Chorus]
I tried, but I don't think so
Maybe it was me who was fucking up
I gave all I could give, but
It seems like it never really was enough46Embed

Babe, you're too controlling

Jerk Lyrics[Refrain]
You say you don't want me
You call me good for nothing
Straight to my face
You say you don't need me
You call me good for nothing
A waste of space

[Verse 1]
Don't remind me
I'm minding my own damn business
Don't try to find me
I'm better left alone than in this
It doesn't surprise me
Do you really think that I could care
If you really don't like me?
Find somebody else
It could be anyone else out there

[Chorus]
Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I never wanna meet you again
One thing
When you're angry, you're a jerk
And then you treat me like I'm worth nothing
Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I never wanna meet you again
It'll happen again
I watch it happen over and over again
[Refrain]
You say you don't want me
You call me good for nothing
Straight to my face
You say you don't need me
You call me good for nothing
A waste of space

[Pre-Chorus]
I watch the walls caving in on me
I'm sick of feeling so fucking lonely
By now I've given up all hope
I guess I'm better off alone

[Chorus]
Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I never wanna meet you again
One thing
When you're angry, you're a jerk
And then you treat me like I'm worth nothing
Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I never wanna meet you again
It'll happen again
I watch it happen over and over again11Embed

I’m Gone Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tell me what you want
Maybe I was wrong
Lately that's a lot
Is this what you wanted?
Tell me what you need
Nothing comes for free
Please just tell me what you wanted
I want it less and less, I guess that
This is why I left

[Chorus]
That's why I'm gone (Ooh-ooh)
Forever long (Ooh-ooh)
I'm gone
They will always find you
I'm gone (Ooh-ooh)
Forever long (Ooh-ooh)
I'm gone
They will always find you

[Verse 2]
I'm running out of options
It happens way too often
I started running into problems again
It happens way too often for me to forget
It's easier said than done
[Bridge]
Something's in my head
I thought this was it
How could I forget
This is why I left?

[Chorus]
That's why I'm gone (Ooh-ooh)
Forever long (Ooh-ooh)
I'm gone
They will always find you
I'm gone (Ooh-ooh)
Forever long (Ooh-ooh)

They will always find you

Tell me what you want
Maybe I was wrong
Lately that's a lot

But it was never enough, of course
Stop acting selfish

All That Lyrics[Refrain]
Whoo, okay
Like you all that, no way

[Verse 1]
Quit running your big mouth like you all that
Nobody catch ya ass when ya fall back
Bitch I look away, I never saw that
I was running through the trenches in a war mask
Stop looking at me like I was deranged (Okay)
Do you ever think I feel your pain? (No way)

[Chorus]
Extraordinary specimen, lit 'til the day I die
Smoke clouds, help me float on by
I've been high my whole goddamn life
Even my mama couldn't tell me why

[Verse 2]
Why I'm such a sick mothafucka
Let me take a hit (Okay)
Now let me take another
I'm falling and I can't stand up
My dad used to tell me man up
Me and my brother put the gloves on
But now I'm too fucked up to function (No way)
I collapsed in the middle of the street, just a block away
[Pre-Refrain]
Acting like you're all that
Go fuck yourself

[Refrain]
Whoo, okay
Like you all that, no way

[Verse 3]
I'm all that and a little bit extra
Fuck the sideline, bitch I'm next up
Recognize when you see my face
Talk a gang of shit while you walk away
Good luck, it's not your day
Maybe next year you can take a break
No way, don't follow me
Bitch, what you want, an apology?
You're a wannabe
I changed my number, stop calling me (Okay)
Google me if you wanna see but don't bother me (No way)
Honestly it's not hard for me, I go super hard
No joke, the kid just broke the wall, goin' supercharged

[Chorus]
An extraordinary specimen, lit 'til the day I die
Smoke clouds, help me float on by
I've been high my whole goddamn life
Even my mama couldn't tell me why

Cash Machine Lyrics[Verse 1]
Shiny like a limousine
You're spending like a cash machine
Smile, show your golden teeth
That's how you cover up your cavities
You're glowing like a diamond ring
I saw you bought some other things
You're spending like a cash machine
To cover up your insecurities
Don't front, no need

[Chorus]
When is it enough?
How bad do you need that stuff?
What's it all for?
Why's it seem like you still want more?
When is it enough?
Turns out you don't need that stuff
What's it all for?
Why's it seem like you still want more?

[Verse 2]
Shiny like a limousine
You're spending like a cash machine
Smile, show your golden teeth
That's how you cover up your cavities
You're not fooling us all
[Bridge]
Someone tell me something
Shut up and take my money
I've got pockets full of gold
No, I don't owe nothing
Stop acting funny
I've seen greedy people hungry
Up in swarms, I've seen them running
Coming for more

[Chorus]
When is it enough?
How bad do you need that stuff?
What's it all for?
Why's it seem like you still want more?
When is it enough?
Turns out you don't need that stuff
What's it all for?
Why's it seem like you still want more?

Movement Lyrics[Intro]
Movement was the thing that made me stop, it made me stop
Movement was the thing that sent me off, it sent me off

[Verse]
Movement was my only tell
Runnin' through the door yelling, "What the hell?"
I'm moving while you talk your talk
Don't talk shit, you gon' break your jaw

"Full speed ahead" was my only plan
I'm moving while you talk your talk
Don't talk shit, you gon' break your jaw

Somebody better help me, son
I'm movin', I've been on the run

Somedays I wake up braindead
Hook me up on life support
Will somebody tell me what I'm fightin' for?

Same shit, risin', I'm comin' up
