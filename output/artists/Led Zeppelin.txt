Stairway to Heaven Lyrics[Intro]

[Verse 1]
There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to Heaven
There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

[Chorus]
Ooh, it  makes me wonder
Ooh, makes me wonder

[Verse 2]
There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

[Chorus]
Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, really makes me wonder
[Verse 3]
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-woahhh

[Verse 4]
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on

[Chorus]
And it makes me wonder
Ohh, woah

[Verse 5]
Your head is humming, and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow? And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one, and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll

[Outro]
And she's buying a stairway to Heaven280Embed

Immigrant Song Lyrics[Intro]​
(2, 3, 4)

[Chorus]
Ahh! Ahh!
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow

[Verse 1]
The hammer of the gods
Will drive our ships to new land
To fight the horde, sing and cry
Valhalla, I am coming

[Refrain]
On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

[Chorus]
Ahh! Ahh!
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow

[Verse 2]
How soft your fields so green
Can whisper tales of gore
Of how we calmed the tides of war
We are your overlords
[Refrain]
On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

[Verse 3]
So now you'd better stop
And rebuild all your ruins
For peace and trust can win the day
Despite of all your losing

[Outro]

Kashmir Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face
With stars to fill my dreams
I am a traveler of both time and space
To be where I have been
Sit with elders of the gentle race
This world has seldom seen
Talk of days for which they sit and wait
All will be revealed

[Verse 2]
Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Whose sounds caress my ear
But not a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 3]
Ooh, baby, I been flying
No yeah, mama, there ain't no denying
Oh, ooh, yeah I've been flying
Mama, mama, ain't no denying, no denying
[Verse 4]
Oh, all I see turns to brown
As the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Trying to find, trying to find, where I've been

[Verse 5]
Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream
Here is the path that led me to that place
Yellow desert stream
My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon
I will return again
Sure as the dust that floats high in June
When movin' through Kashmir

[Verse 6]
Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face
Along the straits of fear
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
Ooooh
[Verse 7/Outro]
Oh, when I'm on, when I'm on my way, yeah
When I see, when I see the way, you stay-yeah
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, when I'm down
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, but I'm down, so down
Ooh, my baby, ooh, my baby, let me take you there
Oh..Come on, oh, let me take you there...let me take you there
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, let me take you there...let me take you there62Embed

Going to California Lyrics[Verse 1]
Spent my days with a woman unkind
Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine
Made up my mind to make a new start
Going to California with an aching in my heart
Someone told me there's a girl out there
With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair

[Verse 2]
Took my chances on a big jet plane
Never let 'em tell you that they're all the same
Oh, the sea was red, and the sky was grey
Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today
The mountains and the canyons start to tremble and shake
The children of the sun began to awake (watch out)

[Verse 3]
Seems that the wrath of the gods
Got a punch on the nose, and it started to flow
I think I might be sinking
Throw me a line, if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there where the path runs straight and high

[Verse 4]
To find a queen without a king
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings... La la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams
Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems, mm...

Ramble On Lyrics[Verse 1]
The leaves are falling all around, time I was on my way
Thanks to you, I'm much obliged for such a pleasant stay
But now it's time for me to go, the autumn moon lights my way
For now I smell the rain, and with it pain, and it's headed my way
Ah, sometimes I grow so tired
But I know I've got one thing I got to do

[Chorus]
Ramble on, and now's the time, the time is now
To sing my song, I'm going 'round the world, I gotta find my girl
On my way, I've been this way ten years to the day
Ramble on, gotta find the queen of all my dreams

[Verse 2]
Got no time to for spreading roots
The time has come to be gone
And though "Our health" we drank a thousand times
It's time to ramble on

[Chorus]
Ramble on, and now the time, the time is now
To sing my song, I'm going 'round the world, I gotta find my girl
On my way, I've been this way ten years to the day
I gotta ramble on, I gotta find the queen of all my dreams
[Bridge]
I tell you no lie

[Verse 3]
Mine's a tale that can't be told, my freedom I hold dear
How years ago in days of old, when magic filled the air
'Twas in the darkest depths of Mordor, I met a girl so fair
But Gollum and the evil one crept up and slipped away with her
Her, her, yeah
Ah, there's nothing I can do now
I guess I'll keep on

[Outro]
Ramblin', I'm gonna shake (Sing my song)
I gotta find my baby
I'm gonna ramble on, sing my song
Gonna work my way, going 'round the world
Baby, baby (Ramble on)
Do do do do do do do do, my baby
I can't stop this feeling in my heart
Every time I think about my baby I think, "We gots to part"
Gotta keep on searching for my baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I gotta keep on searching for my baby
My, my, my, my, my, my, baby
I can't find my bluebird!
I listened to what my bluebird said, but I, I can't find my bluebird!
I keep rambling, baby27Embed

Dazed and Confused Lyrics[Verse 1]
Been dazed and confused for so long, it's not true
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Lots of people talk, and few of them know
Soul of a woman was created below, yeah

[Verse 2]
You hurt and abuse, telling all of your lies
Run 'round, sweet baby, Lord, how they hypnotize
Sweet little baby, I don't know where you've been
Gonna love you, baby, here I come again

[Extra Verse]
If you're going to San Francisco
Be sure to wear some flowers in your hair
If you're going to San Francisco
You're gonna meet a lot of gentle people there

[Verse 3]
Every day I work so hard, bringing home my hard-earned pay
Try to love you, baby, but you push me away
Don't know where you're going, only know just where you've been
Sweet little baby, I want you again

[Instrumental break 1:58-5:25]
[Guitar Solo, with ad libs by Plant]
....oh, don't leave me so confused...
... oohh, baby
[Verse 4]
Been dazed and confused for so long, it's not true
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Take it easy, baby, let them say what they will
Tongue wag so much when I send you the bill
Ooh yeah, all right

Thank You Lyrics[Chorus]
If the sun refused to shine
I would still be loving you
When mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me

[Bridge]
Kind woman, I give you my all
Kind woman, nothing more

[Verse 1]
Little drops of rain whisper of the pain
Tears of loves lost in the days gone by
My love is strong
With you there is no wrong
Together we shall go until we die, my, my, my
An inspiration is what you are to me
Inspiration - look, see

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
And so today, my world, it smiles
Your hand in mine, we walk the miles
And thanks to you it will be done
For you to me are the only one
All right, yeah
Happiness, no more be sad
Happiness - I'm glad
[Chorus]
If the sun refused to shine
I would still be loving you
When mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me16Embed

Babe I’m Gonna Leave You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Babe, baby, baby, I'm gonna leave you
I said, "Baby, you know I'm gonna leave you"

We gonna go walkin' through the park every day
Come what may, every day, oh

I said that's when it's calling me back home30Embed
