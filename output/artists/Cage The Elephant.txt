Cigarette Daydreams Lyrics[Verse 1]
Did you stand there all alone?
Oh, I cannot explain what's going down
I can see you standing next to me
In and out somewhere else right now
You sigh, look away
I can see it clear as day
Close your eyes, so afraid
Hide behind that babyface

[Pre-Chorus]
Do-do-do, do-do-do

[Chorus]
You can drive all night
Looking for the answers in the pouring rain
You wanna find peace of mind
Looking for the answer

[Verse 2]
Funny how it seems like yesterday
As I recall, you were looking out of place
Gathered up your things and slipped away
No time at all, I followed you into the hall
Cigarette daydream
You were only seventeen
Soft speak with a mean streak
Nearly brought me to my knees
[Pre-Chorus]
Do-do-do, do-do-do

[Chorus]
You can drive all night
Looking for the answers in the pouring rain
You wanna find peace of mind
Looking for the answer
If we can find a reason, a reason to change
Looking for the answer
If you can find a reason, a reason to stay
Standing in the pouring rain

[Bridge]
Do-do, do-do-do
Do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do, do-do-do
Do-do, do-do-do-do

[Chorus]
You can drive all night
Looking for the answers in the pouring rain
You wanna find peace of mind
Looking for the answer
If we can find a reason, a reason to change
Looking for the answer
If you can find a reason, a reason to stay
Standing in the pouring rain109Embed

[Verse 1]
We were at the table by the window with the view
Casting shadows, the sun was pushing through
Spoke a lot of words, I don't know if I spoke the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
Got so much to lose
Got so much to prove
God, don't let me lose my mind

[Chorus]
Trouble on my left, trouble on my right
I've been facing trouble almost all my life
My sweet love, won't you pull me through?
Everywhere I look, I catch a glimpse of you
I said it was love and I did it for life, didn't do it for you

Ain’t No Rest for the Wicked Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was walking down the street when out the corner of my eye
I saw a pretty little thing approaching me
She said, "I never seen a man, who looks so all alone
Oh, could you use a little company?
If you pay the right price, your evening will be nice
And you can go and send me on my way."
I said, "You're such a sweet young thing, why you do this to yourself?"
She looked at me and this is what she said:

[Chorus]
"Oh there ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
I got bills to pay, I got mouths to feed
There ain't nothing in this world for free
Oh no, I can't slow down, I can't hold back
Though you know, I wish I could
Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good"

[Verse 2]
Not even fifteen minutes later I'm still walking down the street
When I saw the shadow of a man creep out out of sight
And then he swept up from behind, he put a gun up to my head
He made it clear he wasn't looking for a fight
He said, "Give me all you've got, I want your money, not your life
But if you try to make a move, I won't think twice"
I told him, "You can have my cash, but first you know I gotta ask
What made you want to live this kind of life?"
[Chorus]
He said, "There ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
I got bills to pay, I got mouths to feed
There ain't nothing in this world for free
Oh no, I can't slow down, I can't hold back
Though you know, I wish I could
Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good"

[Verse 3]
Well now a couple hours passed and I was sitting in my house
The day was winding down and coming to an end
And so I turned on the TV and flipped it over to the news
And what I saw I almost couldn't comprehend
I saw a preacher man in cuffs, he'd taken money from the church
He'd stuffed his bank account with righteous dollar bills
But even still I can't say much because I know we're all the same
Oh yes, we all seek out to satisfy those thrills
[Chorus]
You know there ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
We got bills to pay, we got mouths to feed
There ain't nothing in this world for free
Oh no we can't slow down, we can't hold back
Though you know we wish we could
Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good70Embed

Come a Little Closer Lyrics[Verse 1]
Time shakes, found you at the water
At first you were my father, now I love you like a brother
Earthquakes shake the dust behind you
This world at times will blind you
Still I know I'll see you there

[Chorus]
Come a little closer, then you'll see
Come on, come on, come on
Things aren't always what they seem to be
Come on, come on, come on
Do you understand the things that you've been seeing?
Come on, come on, come on
Do you understand the things that you've been dreaming?
Come a little closer, then you'll see

[Verse 2]
Heartbreaks, the heavy world's upon your shoulders
Will we burn on or just smolder?
Somehow I know I'll find you there
Ooh, you wanna see if you can change it, change it
Still I know I'll see you there

[Chorus]
Come a little closer, then you'll see
Come on, come on, come on
Things aren't always what they seem to be
Do you understand the things that you've been seeing?
Come on, come on, come on
Do you understand the things that you've been dreaming?
Come a little closer, then you'll see
Come a little closer, then you'll see
[Bridge]
Ten thousand people stand alone now
And in the evening the sun sank
Tomorrow it will rise
"Time flies by," they all sang along
"Time flies by," they all sang along
"Time flies by," they all sang along
"Time flies by, by"

[Chorus]
Come a little closer, then you'll see
Come on, come on, come on
Come a little closer, then you'll see
Come a little closer, then you'll see
Come a little closer, then you'll see54Embed

Telescope Lyrics[Verse 1]
In a far and distant galaxy
Inside my telescope I see
A pair of eyes peer back at me
He walks and talks and looks like me
He sits around inside his house
From room to room, he moves about
Fills his life with pointless things
And wonders how it all turns out

[Refrain]
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do
It's safe to say that

[Chorus]
I don't think you understand
There's nowhere left to turn
The walls keep breaking
Time is like a leaf in the wind
Either it's time well spent or time I've wasted
Don't waste it

[Verse 2]
Afraid of what the truth might bring
He locks his doors and never leaves
Desperately searching for signs
Too terrified to find a thing
He battens all the hatches down
And wonders why he hears no sounds
Frantically searching his dreams
He wonders what it's all about
[Refrain]
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do
It's safe to say that

[Chorus]
I don't think you understand
There's nowhere left to turn
The walls keep breaking
Time is like a leaf in the wind
Either it's time well spent or time I've wasted

[Bridge]
Here in my mind, losing my friends
Fall on my face, do it again
You say, "How do you do?"
Man, how 'bout you? Man, how 'bout you?
To be free, to be sold
To be killed, to be safe
In my head, I'm alone
I'm not dead, I'm ashamed
Just like you, I've been trying to escape
In my bones, I feel cold
I give thanks to the Lord
Industry, in the street
Let me go, let me be
I don't need to be here
I'm alone, can't you see? Can't you see?
[Chorus]
I don't think you understand
There's nowhere left to turn
These walls keep breaking
Time is like a leaf in the wind
Either it's time well spent or time I've wasted
Don't waste it28Embed

Cold Cold Cold Lyrics[Verse 1]
Doctor, look into my eyes
I've been breathing air, but there's no sign of life
Doctor, the problem's in my chest
My heart feels cold as ice, but it's anybody's guess

[Pre-Chorus]
Doctor, can you help me? 'Cause I don't feel right
Better make it fast before I change my mind
Doctor, can you help me? 'Cause I don't feel right
Better make it fast before I change my mind

[Chorus]
Well, it's cold, cold, cold, cold inside
Darker in the day than the dead of night
Cold, cold, cold, cold inside
Doctor, can you help me? 'Cause something don't feel right
Something don't feel right

[Verse 2]
Sweet nurse, don't look at me that way
I've seen those eyes before, I can tell you want to play
Counselor, give me some advice
Tell me, how hard will I fall if I live a double life?

[Pre-Chorus]
Doctor, can you help me? 'Cause I don't feel right
Better make it fast before I change my mind
Doctor, can you help me? 'Cause I don't feel right
Better make it fast, because there ain't much time
[Chorus]
Well, it's cold, cold, cold, cold inside
Darker in the day than the dead of night
Cold, cold, cold, cold inside
Doctor, can you help me? 'Cause something don't feel right
Something don't feel right
Something just ain't right

[Bridge]
And as the darkness falls, it fills up both my eyes
My life before me like a flash in the night
With my arms open wide

[Chorus]
Well, it's cold, cold, cold, cold inside
Cold, cold, cold, cold inside
Cold, cold, cold, cold inside
Doctor, can you help me? 'Cause something don't feel right
Something don't feel right
Something just ain't right26Embed

Social Cues Lyrics[Verse 1]
I think it's strange when people say
You're the next big thing, you'll never fade
The slightest touch, forced to fold
Sleight of the hand, modern gold

[Pre-Chorus]
Starry-eyed child left behind
Choose your favorite vice
I don't have the strength to play nice

[Chorus]
Hide me in the back room, tell me when it's over
Don't know if I can play this part much longer
I'll be in the back room, tell me when it's over
Don't know if I can play this part much longer
I don't know if it is right to live this way, yeah
I'll be in the back room, tell me when it's over
People always say, "Man, at least you're on the radio"

[Post-Chorus]
At least you're on the radio, oh
At least you're on the radio, huh
At least you're on the radio, oh

[Verse 2]
Close your eyes, don't be afraid
Take some of these, they'll ease the pain
Live fast, die young, pay the price
The best die young, immortalized
[Pre-Chorus]
Starry-eyed children left behind
To choose their favorite vice
I don't have the strength to think twice

[Chorus]
Hide me in the back room, tell me when it's over
Don't know if I can play this part much longer
I'll be in the back room, tell me when it's over
Don't know if I can play this part much longer
I don't know if it is right to live this way, yeah
I'll be in the back room, tell me when it's over
People always say, "Man, at least you're on the radio"

At least you're on the radio, oh
At least you're on the radio, huh

Hide me in the back room, tell me when it's over
Don't know if I can play this part much longer
I'll be in the back room, tell me when it's over
Don't know if I can play this part much longer
I don't know if it is right to live this way, yeah

Ready to Let Go Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sun went down, sun went down over Pompeii
On both sides, a vow was broken
Oh my, my, I'm the one
Trying to hide this damage done
One day, all our secrets will be spoken

[Pre-Chorus]
As we slow danced, I became your statue, frozen
Times I wonder are we just a puff of smoke? Yeah
Underneath this bed of ashes, still withholding everything
Like we were never close

[Chorus]
Don’t you worry, baby, no sense trying to change it
I'ma strike these matches, never had control
I'm ready to let go, no, was I fooling myself?
I’ma spread these ashes, never had control
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready to let go

[Verse 2]
Sun went down, sun went down over Pompeii
On holy ground, our vows were broken
We met up, we broke bread
I was blue, your dress was red
Ain't it strange?
We both knew this day was coming
[Pre-Chorus]
As we slow danced, I became your statue, frozen
Times I wonder are we just a puff of smoke? Yeah
Underneath this bed of ashes, still withholding everything
Like we were never close

[Chorus]
Don't you worry, baby, no sense trying to change it
I'ma strike these matches, never had control
I'm ready to let go, no, was I fooling myself?
I’ma spread these ashes, never had control
I’m ready, I'm ready, I’m ready to let go

[Chorus]
Don't you worry, baby, no sense trying to change it

Sweetie Little Jean Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sweetie Little Jean, where did you go?
Everyone's been searching high and low
And your mother's worried sick
Dearest daddy lost his grip
While the whole world's watching
Candlelight vigils being held in silence
On the channel four
And they've knocked on every door
Every place you've been before

[Refrain]
How long will we let it go?
I think we should just let go

[Chorus]
I, I want you back (back)
Let's get back
Lay my weary head against your bones
Where all my troubles will be dead and gone

[Refrain]
How long will we let it go?
I think we should just let go

[Verse 2]
Has melancholy taken you for good?
You know that I would save you if I could
Watched your laughter turn to tears
Then you vanished in thin air
Well we pinned your missing persons picture up
On every mother-loving post
How's it feel to be a ghost?
You're the one I love the most
[Chorus 2]
I, I want you back (back)
Let's get back
Lay my weary head against your breast
Where all our troubles will be laid to rest

[Verse 3]
I pushed and I pulled 'til I pushed you aside
Now all that is left are the tears that you cried
I'm sorry love for all of the damage done
My only hope is someday to be back beside you

[Chorus]
I, I want you back (back)
Let's get back
Lay my weary head against your bones
Where all our troubles will be dead and gone

How long will we let it go?

Shake Me Down Lyrics[Verse 1]
Shake me down, not a lot of people left around
Who knows now? Softly laying on the ground
Oooh not a lot of people left around oooh oooh

[Verse 2]
In my life I have seen people walk into the sea
Just to find memories plagued by constant misery
Their eyes cast down, fixed upon the ground
Their eyes cast down

[Chorus 1]
I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun

[Verse 3]
Shake me down, cut my head on a silver cloud
Broken sound, softly laying on the ground
Oooh not a lot of people left around oooh oooh

[Verse 4]
In my past, bittersweet, there's no love between the sheets
Taste the blood, broken dreams, lonely times in deed
With eyes cast down, fixed upon the ground, with eyes cast down

[Chorus 2]
I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun
Turn back now, it's time for me to let go
Way down, had to find a place to lay low
Lamp shade, turned around into a light post
[Bridge]
Walk around the corner, never saw it coming, still
I try to make a move it almost stopped me from belief
I don't want to know the future, I'm like Rolling Thunder
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day

[Chorus 3]
I'll keep my eyes fixed on the-
I'll keep my eyes fixed on the-
I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun
