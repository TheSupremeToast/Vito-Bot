Californication Lyrics[Verse 1]
Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind's elation
And little girls from Sweden dream of silver-screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams, it's Californication

[Verse 2]
It's the edge of the world and all of Western civilization
The sun may rise in the East, at least it settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication

[Bridge]
Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin: is this your chin or is that war you're waging?

[Pre-Chorus]
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

[Chorus]
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

[Verse 3]
Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication
[Verse 4]
Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain, can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station to Station?
And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication

[Bridge]
Born and raised by those who praise control of population
Well, everybody's been there, and I don't mean on vacation

[Pre-Chorus]
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

[Chorus]
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 5]
Destruction leads to a very rough road but it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar, they're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication
[Bridge]
Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest, there is no test, but this is what you're craving

[Pre-Chorus]
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Under the Bridge Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in, The City of Angels
Lonely as I am together we cry

[Verse 2]
I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
Well, I never worry, now that is a lie

[Chorus]
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah yeah

[Verse 3]
It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
At least I have her love
The city, she loves me
Lonely as I am together we cry
[Chorus]
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah yeah
Oh, no, no, no, yeah yeah
Love me, I say, yeah yeah

Is where I drew some blood
(Under the bridge downtown)
I could not get enough

Forgot about my love

I gave my life away, yeah

Can’t Stop Lyrics[Verse 1]
Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation

[Verse 2]
Defunct, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side love is living on the West End

[Verse 3]
Knocked out, but, boy, you better come to (Oh, oh-oh)
Don't die, you know, the truth as some do (Oh-oh)
Go write your message on the pavement (Oh-oh)
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant

[Pre-Chorus 1]
White heat is screamin' in the jungle (Oh, oh-oh)
Complete the motion if you stumble (Oh-oh)
Go ask the dust for any answers (Oh-oh)
Come back strong with fifty belly dancers

[Chorus]
The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to
[Verse 4]
Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone
So smart, she's leadin' me to ozone
Music, the great communicator
Use two sticks to make it in the nature

[Verse 5]
I'll get you into penetration
The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight, the gold of meditation

[Verse 6]
This chapter's gonna be a close one (Oh, oh-oh)
Smoke rings, I know you're gonna blow one (Oh-oh)
All on a spaceship, persevering (Oh-oh)
Use my hands for everything but steering

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Can't stop the spirits when they need you (Oh, oh-oh)
Mop tops are happy when they feed you (Oh-oh)
J. Butterfly is in the treetop (Oh-oh)
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop

[Chorus]
The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to
[Bridge]
Wait a minute, I'm passin' out, win or lose
Just like you
Far more shockin' than anything I ever knew
How 'bout you?
Ten more reasons why I need somebody new
Just like you
Far more shockin' than anything I ever knew
Right on cue

Can't stop, addicted to the shindig

[Verse 7]
Kick start the golden generator
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her
Can't stop the gods from engineering
Feel no need for any interfering

[Verse 8]
Your image in the dictionary
This life is more than ordinary
Can I get two, maybe even three of these?
Comin' from the space to teach you of the Pleiades

[Outro]
Can't stop the spirits when they need you
This life is more than just a read-through89Embed

Scar Tissue Lyrics[Verse 1]
Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
'Cause with the birds I'll share

[Chorus]
With the birds, I'll share this lonely view

Young Kentucky girl in a push-up bra

To lick your heart and taste your health, 'cause

A southern girl with a scarlet drawl

I'll make it to the moon if I have to crawl and

Otherside Lyrics[Chorus]
How long, how long will I slide?
Well, separate my side
I don't, I don't believe it's bad
Slittin' my throat, is all I ever

[Verse 1]
I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up it brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back
I gotta take it on the otherside

[Verse 2]
Well, centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I marry the sea
The stranger things that never change my mind
I gotta take it on the otherside

[Pre-Chorus]
Take it on the otherside
Take it on, take it on

[Chorus]
How long, how long will I slide?
A-separate my side
I don't, I don't believe it's bad
A-slittin' my throat, is all I ever
[Verse 3]
Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full and I'm spillin' my guts
She want to know am I still a slut?
I gotta take it on the otherside

[Verse 4]
A scarlet starlet and she's in my bed
A candidate for my soul mate bled
Mmm, push the trigger and I pull the thread
I gotta take it on the otherside

[Pre-Chorus]
Take it on the otherside
Take it on, take it on

How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side
I don't, I don't believe it's bad
A-slittin' my throat, is all I ever

Turn me on, take me for a hard ride
Burn me out, leave me on the otherside
I yell and tell it that it's not my friend
I tear it down, I tear it down, and then it's born again

How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side
I don't, I don't believe it's bad
A-slittin' my throat, is all I ever had

Snow (Hey Oh) Lyrics[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Come to decide that the things that I tried
Were in my life just to get high on
When I sit alone, come get a little known
But I need more than myself this time
Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe that we rely on
When I lay it on, come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice

[Refrain: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
Hey, oh
Listen what I say, oh
I got your— Hey, oh
Now listen what I say, oh
(Oh)

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
When will I know that I really can't go
To the well once more time to decide on
When it's killing me, when will I really see
All that I need to look inside?
Come to believe that I better not leave
Before I get my chance to ride
When it's killing me, what do I really need
All that I need to look inside?
[Refrain: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
Hey, oh
Listen what I say, oh
Come back and— Hey, oh
Look at what I say, oh

The more I see, the less I know
The more I like to let it go
Hey, oh! Whoa-whoa

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Finally divided by a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go
In between the cover of another perfect wonder
And it's so white as snow
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go
Ho!

[Verse 3: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
When to descend to amend for a friend
All the channels that have broken down
Now you bring it up, I'm gonna ring it up
Just to hear you sing it out
Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe what we rely on
When I lay it on, come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice
[Refrain: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
Hey, oh
Listen what I say, oh
I got your— Hey, oh
Listen what I say, oh

Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go

Oh, yeah! Tell my love now

Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go

Dani California Lyrics[Produced by Rick Rubin]

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Gettin' born in the state of Mississippi
Poppa was a copper and her momma was a hippie
In Alabama, she would swing a hammer
Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama
She never knew that there was  anything more than poor
What in the world, what does your company take me for?
Black bandana, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner
On her merry way sayin', "Baby, what you gonna—?"
Lookin' down the barrel of a hot metal .45
Just another way to survive

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
She's a lover, baby and a fighter
Shoulda seen her comin' when it got a little brighter
With a name like Dani California
Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya
A little loaded, she was stealin' another breath
I love my baby to death
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: John Frusciante]
Who knew the other side of you?
Who knew what others died to prove?
Too true to say goodbye to you
Too true to say, say, say

[Verse 3: Anthony Kiedis]
Push the fader, gifted animator
One for the now and eleven for the later
Never made it up to Minnesota
North Dakota man was a gunnin' for the quota
Down in the Badlands, she was savin' the best for last
It only hurts when I laugh
Gone too fast

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest, yeah, yeah
California, rest in peace (Do svidaniya)

Dark Necessities Lyrics[Verse 1]
Comin' on to the light of day, we got
Many moons that are deep at play so I
Keep an eye on the shadow smile to see what it has to say
You and I both know, everything must go away
Ah, what do you say?
Spinnin' knot that is on my heart is like a
Bit of light in a touch of dark, you got
Sneak attack from the zodiac but I see your fire spark
Eat the breeze and go, blow by blow and go away
Oh, what do you say? Yeah

[Chorus]
You don't know my mind, you don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design and
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design

No time for the afterthought, they're like
Ice Cream for an Astronaut, well, that's me looking for we
Turn the corner and find the world at your command
Playin' the hand, yeah

Do you want it, do you want it now?
Do you want it all the time? But darkness helps us all to shine
Do you want it, do you want it now?

Ah, pick you up like a paperback with the
Track record of a maniac so I
Move it in and we unpack, it's the same as yesterday
Any way we roll, everything must go away
Oh, what do you say? Yeah

You don't know my mind, you don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky and
Dark necessities are part of my design

Steak knife, card shark
Con job, boot cut

To get there quick by street but not the freeway
Turn that trick to make a little leeway
Beat that nic, but not the way that we play

Rib cage, soft tail

Give It Away Lyrics[Intro]
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
What I got, you got to give it to your mamma
What I got, you've got to give it to your pappa
What I got, you got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water
What I got, you got to get it put it in you
What I got, you got to get it put it in you
What I got, you got to get it put it in you
Reeling with the feeling, don't stop, continue
I realize I don't want to be a miser
Confide with sly you'll be the wiser
Young blood is the lovin' upriser
How come everybody wanna keep it like the Kaiser?

[Chorus]

Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper

[Verse 2]
Greedy little people in a sea of distress
Keep your more to receive your less
Unimpressed by material excess
Love is free, love me, say, "Hell, yes"
Low brow but I rock a little know how
No time for the piggies or the hoosegow
Get smart get down with the pow wow
Never been a better time than right now
Bob Marley poet and a prophet
Bob Marley taught me how to off it
Bob Marley walkin' like he talk it
Goodness me, can't you see I'm gonna cough it?
