Ridin' on a horse, ha

Hat down, cross town, livin' like a rockstar
Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby's got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras
Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I've been through all that
I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
Wish I could roll on back to that old town road
I wanna ride 'til I can't no more

MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I caught it bad yesterday
You hit me with a call to your place
Ain't been out in a while anyway
Was hopin' I could catch you throwin' smiles in my face
Romantic talkin'? You don't even have to try
You're cute enough to fuck with me tonight
Lookin' at the table, all I see is weed and white
Baby, you livin' the life, but nigga, you ain't livin' right

[Pre-Chorus]
Cocaine and drinkin' with your friends
You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend
I'm not fazed, only here to sin
If Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can

[Chorus]
Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me in the morning, I'll be on the way
Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me out by your name, I'll be on the way like

[Post-Chorus]
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm
[Verse 2]
Ayy, ayy
I wanna sell what you're buyin'
I wanna feel on your ass in Hawaii
I want that jet lag from fuckin' and flyin'
Shoot a child in your mouth while I'm ridin'
Oh, oh, oh, why me?
A sign of the times every time that I speak
A dime and a nine, it was mine every week
What a time, an incline, God was shinin' on me
Now I can't leave
And now I'm actin' hella elite
Never want the niggas that's in my league
I wanna fuck the ones I envy, I envy

[Pre-Chorus]
Cocaine and drinkin' with your friends
You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend
I'm not fazed, only here to sin
If Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can

[Chorus]
Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me in the morning, I'll be on the way
Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me out by your name, I'll be on the way like
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, call me by your name (Mmm, mmm, mmm)
Tell me you love me in private
Call me by your name (Mmm, mmm, mmm)

THATS WHAT I WANT Lyrics[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Need a boy who can cuddle with me all night
Keep me warm, love me long, be my sunlight
Tell me lies, we can argue, we can fight
Yeah, we did it before, but we'll do it tonight
An afro, black boy with the gold teeth
With dark skin, lookin' at me like he know me
I wonder if he got the G or the B
Let me find out and see, comin' over to me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
These days, I'm way too lonely
I'm missin' out, I know
These days, I'm way too alone
And I'm known for givin' love away, but

I want someone to love mе
I need someone who needs me
'Causе it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me in my dreams
So I want someone to love
That's what I fuckin' want
[Verse 2]
Look, you know it's harder to find in these times
But I got nothin' but love on my mind (My mind)
I need a baby with love in my prime
Need an adversary to my down and marry
Like, tell me "That's life" when I'm stressin' at night
Be like, "You'll be okay" and, "Everything is alright," uh
Let me in that thing, 'cause I'm not wanting anything
But your loving, your body, and a little bit of your brain

[Pre-Chorus]
These days, I'm way too lonely
I'm missin' out, I know
These days, I'm way too alone
And I'm known for givin' love away, but

I want someone to love me
I need someone who needs me
'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me in my dreams
So I want someone to love
That's what I fuckin' want

I want someone to love me
I need someone who needs me

C7osure (You Like) Lyrics[Chorus]
True say, I want and I need
To let go, use my time to be free
It's like it's always what you like
It's always what you like
Why it's always what you like?
It's always what you like, huh

[Post-Chorus]
Ain't no more actin', man, that forecast say I should just let me grow
No more red light for me, baby, only green, I gotta go
Pack my past up in the back, oh, let my future take ahold
This is what I gotta do, can't be regrettin' when I'm old

[Verse]
Brand new places I'll choose and I'll go, I know
Embracin' this news I behold unfolding
I know, I know, I know it don't feel like it's time
But I look back at this moment, I'll see that I'm fine
I know, I know, I know it don't feel like it's time
I set boundaries for myself, it's time to cross the line

True say, I want and I need
To let go, use my time to be free
It's like it's always what you like
It's always what you like

SUN GOES DOWN Lyrics[Chorus]
I wanna run away
Don't wanna lie, I don't want a life
Send me a gun and I'll see the sun
I'd rather run away
Don't wanna lie, I don't want a life
Send me a gun and I'll see the sun

[Post-Chorus]
You need an instant ease
From your life where you got plenty
Of every hurt and heartbreak (Oh)
You just take it all to the face
I know that you want to cry
But there's much more to life than dyin'
Over your past mistakes (Oh)
And people who threw dirt on your name

[Verse]
Since ten, I been feelin' lonely
Had friends, but they was pickin' on me
Always thinkin', "Why my lips so big?
Was I too dark? Can they sense my fears?"
These gay thoughts would always haunt me
I prayed God would take it from me
It's hard for you when you're fightin'
And nobody knows it when you're silent
I'd be by the phone
Stanning Nicki mornin' into dawn
Only place I felt like I belonged
Strangers make you feel so loved, you know?
And I'm happy by the way
That I made that jump, that leap of faith
I'm happy that it all worked out for me
I'ma make my fans so proud of me, oh
[Chorus]
I wanna run away
Don't wanna lie, I don't want a life
Send me a gun and I'll see the sun
I'd rather run away
Don't wanna lie, I don't want a life
Send me a gun and I'll see the sun

[Post-Chorus]
You need an instant ease
From your life where you got plenty
Of every hurt and heartbreak (Oh)
You just take it all to the face
I know that you want to cry
But there's much more to life than dying
Over your past mistakes (Oh)
And people who threw dirt on your name
