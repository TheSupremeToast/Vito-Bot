Don’t Stop Believin’ Lyrics[Verse 1]
Just a small-town girl, livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere
Just a city boy, born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

[Verse 2]
A singer in a smoky room
The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile, they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night
Streetlights, people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

[Verse 3]
Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time
[Verse 4]
Some will win, some will lose
Some are born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night
Streetlights, people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Streetlights, people
Don't stop believin'
Hold on
Streetlights, people
Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Streetlights, people113Embed

Faithfully Lyrics[Verse 1]
Highway run into the midnight sun
Wheels go 'round and 'round, you're on my mind
Restless hearts sleep alone tonight
Sendin' all my love along the wire

[Chorus]
They say that the road ain't no place to start a family
Right down the line, it's been you and me
And lovin' a music man ain't always what it's supposed to be
Oh, girl, you stand by me
I'm forever yours
Faithfully

[Verse 2]
Circus life under the big top world
We all need the clowns to make us smile
Through space and time, always another show
Wonderin' where I am, lost without you

[Chorus]
And bein' apart ain't easy on this love affair
Two strangers learn to fall in love again
I get the joy of rediscovering you
Oh, girl, you stand by me
I'm forever yours
Faithfully
[Outro]
Whoa-oh, oh-oh
Whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Faithfully
I'm still yours
I'm forever yours

Open Arms Lyrics[Verse 1]
Lying beside you
Here in the dark
Feeling your heartbeat with mine
Softly you whisper
You're so sincere
How could our love be so blind?

[Pre-Chorus]
We sailed on together
We drifted apart
And here you are
By my side

[Chorus]
So now I come to you
With open arms
Nothing to hide
Believe what I say
So here I am
With open arms
Hoping you'll see
What your love means to me
Open arms

[Verse 2]
Living without you
Living alone
This empty house seems so cold
Wanting to hold you
Wanting you near
How much I wanted you home
[Pre-Chorus]
But now that you've come back
Turned night into day
I need you to stay

[Chorus]
So now I come to you
With open arms
Nothing to hide
Believe what I say
So here I am
With open arms
Hoping you'll see
What your love means to me

Separate Ways (Worlds Apart) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Here we stand
Worlds apart, hearts broken in two, two, two
Sleepless nights
Losing ground, I'm reaching for you, you, you
Feeling that it's gone
Can't change your mind
If we can't go on
To survive the tide
Love divides

[Chorus]
Someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you
One night will remind you
How we touched and went our separate ways
If he ever hurts you
True love won't desert you
You know I still love you
Though we touched and went our separate ways

[Verse 2]
Troubled times
Caught between confusion and pain, pain, pain
Distant eyes
Promises we made were in vain, in vain, in vain
If you must go
I wish you luck
You'll never walk alone
Take care, my love
Miss you, love
[Chorus]
Someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you
One night will remind you
How we touched and went our separate ways
If he ever hurts you
True love won't desert you
You know I still love you
Though we touched and went our separate ways

[Chorus]
Oh, someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you
One night will remind you
If he ever hurts you
True love won't desert you
You know I still love you

[Outro]
I still love you, girl
I really love you, girl
And if he ever hurts you
True love won't desert you
No!

When the lights go down in the City
And the sun shines on the bay
Ooh, I wanna be there in my City, oh

Without your charms

Wheel in the Sky Lyrics[Verse 1]
Winter is here again, oh lord
Haven't been home in a year or more
I hope she holds on a little longer
Sent a letter on a long summer day
Made of silver, not of clay
Ooh, I've been runnin' down this dusty road

[Chorus]
Ooh, the wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'
I don't know where I'll be tomorrow
Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'
[Verse 2]
I've been trying to make it home
Got to make it before too long
Ooh, I can't take this very much longer, no
I'm standing in the sleet and rain
Don't think I'm ever gonna make it home again
The morning sun is risin', it's kissin' the day

[Chorus]
Ooh, the wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'
I don't know where I'll be tomorrow
Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'
Whoa, whoa, whoa
My, my, my, my, my
For tomorrow
[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Oh, the wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'
Ooh, I don't know where I'll be tomorrow
Wheel in the sky keeps me yearnin'
Ooh, I don't know, I don't know, whoa

[Chorus]
Oh, the wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'
Ooh, I don't know where I'll be tomorrow
Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'
Ooh, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, whoa

Lovin’, Touchin’, Squeezin’ Lyrics[Verse 1]
You make me weep, and wanna die
Just when you said we'd try
Loving, touching, squeezing each other
When I'm alone all by myself
You're out with someone else
Loving, touching, squeezing each other

[Chorus 1]
You're tearing me apart
Every, every day
You're tearing me apart
Oh, what can I say?
You're tearing me apart

[Verse 2]
It won't be long, yes, 'til you're alone
When your lover, oh, he hasn't come home
'Cause he's loving, ooh, he's touching
He's squeezing another

He's tearing you apart
Ooh, every, every day
He's tearing you apart
Oh, girl, what can you say?
Cause he's loving, touching another

Stone In Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Those crazy nights, I do remember in my youth
I do recall, those were the best times, most of all
In the heat with a blue jean girl
Burning love comes once in a lifetime
She found me singing by the rail road tracks
Took me home, we danced by the moonlight

[Chorus]
Those summer nights are calling
Stone in love
Can't help myself, I'm falling
Stone in love

[Verse 2]
Old dusty roads, led to the river
Running slow
She pulled me down, ooh, and in clover
We'd go around, yeah
In the heat with a blue jean girl
Burning love comes once in a lifetime
Oh, the memories never fade away
Golden girl, I'll keep you forever

[Chorus]
Those summer nights are calling
Stone in love
Can't help myself, I'm falling
Stone in love
[Chorus]
Those summer nights are calling
Stone in love
Can't help myself, I'm falling

Who’s Crying Now Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's been a mystery
And still they try to see
Why something good can hurt so bad
Caught on a one-way street
The taste of bittersweet
Love will survive somehow, some way

[Chorus]
One love feeds the fire
One heart burns desire
I wonder, who's crying now?
Two hearts born to run
Who'll be the lonely one?
I wonder who's crying now?

[Verse 2]
So many stormy nights
So many wrongs or rights
Neither could change
Their headstrong ways
And in a lover's rage
They tore another page
The fighting is worth
The love they save
[Chorus]
One love feeds the fire
One heart burns desire
I wonder who's crying now?
Two hearts born to run
Who'll be the lonely one?
I wonder who's crying now?

[Bridge]
Only so many tears you can cry
'Till the heartache is over
And now you can say your love
Will never die

Whoooooa-oh-whoa
Whoooa-oh
Ooooooh-whoa, ooh-whooa

[Chorus]
One love feeds the fire
One heart burns desire
Wonder who's crying now?
Two hearts born to run
Who will be the lonely one?
Wonder who's crying now?5Embed
