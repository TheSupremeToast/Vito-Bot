Still into You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Can't count the years on one hand
That we've been together
I need the other one to hold you
Make you feel, make you feel better
It's not a walk in the park
To love each other
But when our fingers interlock
Can't deny, can't deny you're worth it

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause after all this time, I'm still into you

[Chorus]
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you

[Verse 2]
Recount the night that I first met your mother
And on the drive back to my house
I told you that, I told you that I loved ya
You felt the weight of the world
Fall off your shoulder
And to your favorite song
We sang along to the start of forever
[Pre-Chorus]
And after all this time, I'm still into you

[Chorus]
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby, even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you

[Bridge]
Well, some things just, some things just make sense
And one of those is you and I (Hey)
Some things just, some things just make sense
And even after all this time (Hey)
I'm into you
Baby, not a day goes by
That I'm not into you

[Chorus]
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby, even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you

I'm still into you

Hard Times Lyrics[Verse 1]
All that I want
Is to wake up fine
Tell me that I'm all right
That I ain't gonna die
All that I want
Is a hole in the ground
You can tell me when it's alright
For me to come out

[Chorus]
(Hard times) Gonna make you wonder why you even try
(Hard times) Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry
(These lives) And I still don't know how I even survive
(Hard times)
(Hard times)
And I gotta get to rock bottom (Oof)

[Verse 2]
Walking around
With my little rain cloud
Hanging over my head
And it ain't coming down
Where do I go?
Gimme some sort of sign
You hit me with lightning!
Maybe I'll come alive
[Chorus]
(Hard times) Gonna make you wonder why you even try
(Hard times) Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry
(These lives) And I still don't know how I even survive
(Hard times)
(Hard times)
And I gotta hit rock bottom (Oof)

[Bridge]
Tell my friends I'm coming down
We'll kick it when I hit the ground
Tell my friends I'm coming down
We'll kick it when I hit the ground
When I hit the ground
When I hit the ground
When I hit the ground
When I hit the ground

[Chorus]
(Hard times) Gonna make you wonder why you even try
(Hard times) Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry
(These lives) And I still don't know how I even survive
(Hard times) Hard times
(Hard times) Hard times
(Hard times) Gonna make you wonder why you even try
(Hard times) Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry
(These lives) And I still don't know how I even survive
(Hard times) Hard times
(Hard times)
[Outro]
Hard times
Makes you wonder why you even try
Makes you wonder why you even try
Makes you wonder why you even try
Makes you wonder
Hard times
Still don't know how I even survive
Still don't know how I even survive
Still don't know how I even survive
Still don't know how
I survive
And I gotta get to rock bottom (Oof)73Embed

Misery Business Lyrics[Intro]
Hit that, hit that snare

[Verse 1]
I'm in the business of misery, let's take it from the top
She's got a body like an hourglass, it's ticking like a clock
It's a matter of time before we all run out
When I thought he was mine, she caught him by the mouth
I waited eight long months, she finally set him free
I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
Two weeks and we caught on fire
She's got it out for me, but I wear the biggest smile

[Chorus]
Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him now
And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

[Verse 2]
Second chances, they don't ever matter, people never change
Once a whore, you're nothing more, I'm sorry, that'll never change
And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
I'm sorry, honey, but I passed it up, now look this way
Well, there's a million other girls who do it just like you
Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
They want and what they like, it's easy if you do it right
Well I refuse, I refuse, I refuse!
[Chorus]
Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him right now
And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

[Bridge]
I watched his wildest dreams come true
And not one of them involving you
Just watch my wildest dreams come true
Not one of them involving

[Guitar Solo]

[Breakdown]
Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now

[Chorus]
Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him now
And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so

The Only Exception Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I was younger I saw my daddy cry
And curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it
And my momma swore that she would
Never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist

[Chorus]
But darling
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

[Verse 2]
Maybe I know somewhere deep in my soul
That love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways to make it alone
Or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now I had sworn to myself that I'm content
With loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk
[Chorus]
Well, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

[Bridge]
I've got a tight grip on reality but I can't
Let go of what's in front of me here
I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream
Whoa-oh-oh

[Chorus]
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

[Outro]
And I'm on my way to believing
Oh, and I'm on my way to believing50Embed

26 Lyrics[Verse 1]
Man, you really know how to get someone down
Everything was fine, until you came around
And I've been chasing after dreamers in the clouds
After all wasn't I the one who said
To keep your feet on the ground?
Man, you really brought me back down

[Chorus]
Hold onto hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
And they say that dreaming is free
But I wouldn't care what it cost me

[Verse 2]
You got me tied up, but I stay close to the window
And I talk to myself about the places that I used to go
I'm hoping someday maybe I'll just float away
And I'll forget every cynical thing you said
When you gonna hear me out?
Man, you really bring me down

[Chorus]
Hold onto hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
And they say that dreaming is free
But I wouldn't care what it cost me
[Bridge]
Reality will break your heart
Survival will not be the hardest part
It's keeping all your hopes alive
When all the rest of you has died
So let it break your heart

[Chorus]
Hold onto hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
Hold onto hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
And they say that dreaming is free
But I wouldn't care what it cost me25Embed

Rose-Colored Boy Lyrics[Intro]
Low-key, no pressure
Just hang with me and my weather
Low-key, no pressure
Just hang with me and my weather

[Verse 1]
Rose-colored boy
I hear you making all that noise
About the world you want to see
And oh, I'm so annoyed
'Cause I just killed off what was left of
The optimist in me

[Pre-Chorus]
But hearts are breaking, and wars are raging on
And I have taken my glasses off
You got me nervous
I'm right at the end of my rope
A half empty girl
Don't make me laugh, I'll choke

[Chorus]
Just let me cry a little bit longer
I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to
Hey, man, we all can't be like you
I wish we were all rose-colored too
My rose-colored boy
[Post-Chorus]
Low-key, no pressure
Just hang with me and my weather

[Verse 2]
I want you to stop insisting that I'm not
A lost cause, 'cause I've been through a lot
Really all I've got is just to stay pissed off
If it's all right by you

[Pre-Chorus]
But hearts are breaking, and wars are raging on
And I have taken my glasses off
You got me nervous
And you're turning it into a joke
A half empty girl
Don't make me laugh, I'll...

[Chorus]
Just let me cry a little bit longer
I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to
Hey, man, we all can't be like you
I wish we were all rose-colored too
My rose-colored boy

[Bridge]
(Hm, hm, hm, hm)
(Hoo-hoo-hoo)
Leave me here a little bit longer
I think I wanna stay in the car
I don't want anybody seeing me cry now
You say "We gotta look on the bright side"
I say "Well, maybe if you wanna go blind"
You say my eyes are getting too dark now
But boy, you ain't ever seen my mind
[Chorus]
Just let me cry a little bit longer
I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to
Hey, man, we all can't be like you
I wish we were all rose-colored too
My rose-colored boy
Just let me cry a little bit longer
I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to
I know we all can't be like you
I wish we were all rose-colored too
My rose-colored boy

Ain’t It Fun Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't mind
Lettin' you down easy, but just give it time
If it don't hurt now, well just wait, just wait a while
You're not the big fish in the pond no more
You are what they're feedin' on

So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you? (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ah-ah-ah)

You see it's easy to ignore trouble
When you're livin' in a bubble

When the world don't orbit around you? (Mm-mm-mm-ah-ah-ah)

That’s What You Get Lyrics[Verse 1]
No, sir
Well, I don't wanna be the blame, not anymore
It's your turn
So take a seat, we're settling the final score
And why do we like to hurt so much?
I can't decide
You have made it harder just to go on
And why?
All the possibilities, well, I was wrong

[Chorus 1]
That's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
That's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating
And that's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I wonder
How am I supposed to feel when you're not here?
'Cause I burned
Every bridge I ever built when you were here
I still try
Holding onto silly things, I never learn
Oh, why?
All the possibilities, I'm sure you've heard
[Chorus 1]
That's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
That's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating (Beating)
And that's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
Pain, make your way to me, to me
And I'll always be just so (So) inviting
If I ever start to think straight
This heart will start a riot in me
Let's start, start, hey!

[Refrain: Hayley Williams, Hayley Williams, Josh Farro, Zac Farro, Jeremy Davis & Steve Smith]
Why do we like to hurt so much?
Oh, why do we like to hurt so much?
That's what you get when you let your heart win

That's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
That's what you get when you let your heart win

Fake Happy Lyrics[Intro]
I love making you believe
What you get is what you see
But I'm so fake happy
I feel so fake happy

And I bet everybody here
Is just as insincere
We're all so fake happy
And I know fake happy

[Verse 1]
So I been doin' a good job
Of makin' 'em think
I'm quite alright
But I hope I don't blink
You see, it's easy when I'm stompin' on a beat
But no one sees me when I crawl back underneath

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, if I smile with my teeth
Bet you'd believe me
If I smile with my teeth
I think I'd believe me

[Chorus]
Oh please, don't ask me how I've been
Don't make me play pretend
Oh no, oh what's the use?
Oh please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too
[Verse 2]
And if I go out tonight
Dress up my fears
You think I look alright with these mascara tears?
See, I'm gonna draw my lipstick wider than my mouth
And if the lights are low, they'll never see me frown

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, if I smile with my teeth
I bet you'd believe me
If I smile with my teeth
I think I'd believe me

[Chorus]
Oh please, don't ask me how I've been
Don't make me play pretend
Oh no, oh oh, what's the use?
Oh please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too

I know I said that I was doin' good and that I'm happy now
Ooh ooh
I shoulda known when things were goin' good
That's when I'd get knocked down (ah!)

Last Hope Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't even know myself at all
I thought I would be happy by now
The more I try to push it, I realize
Gotta let go of control

[Refrain]
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Just let it happen

[Chorus]
It's just a spark, but it's enough
To keep me going
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing

[Verse 2]
Every night I try my best to dream
Tomorrow makes it better
Then I wake up to the cold reality
And not a thing has changed

[Refrain]
But it will happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
[Chorus]
It's just a spark, but it's enough
To keep me going
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing
It's just a spark, but it's enough
To keep me going
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing

[Verse 3]
And the salt in my wounds
Isn't burning any more than it used to
It's not that I don't feel the pain
It's just I'm not afraid of hurting anymore
And the blood in these veins
Isn't pumping any less than it ever has
And that's the hope I have
The only thing I know that's keeping me alive
Alive

[Bridge]
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
[Chorus]
It's just a spark, but it's enough
To keep me going
(So if I let go of control now, I can be strong)
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing
It's just a spark, but it's enough
To keep me going
(So if I keep my eyes closed, with the blind hope)
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing
