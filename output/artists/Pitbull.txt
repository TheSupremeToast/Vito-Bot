Ask for advice, get money twice
I'm from the dirty, but that chico nice
Y'all call it a moment, I call it life

Give Me Everything Lyrics[Intro: Pitbull]

Take advantage of tonight (Yeah)
'Cause tomorrow I'm off to Dubai to perform for a princess
But tonight, I can make you my queen
And make love to you endless (Yeah)
This is insane: the way the name growin'
Money keep flowin', hustlers move in silence
So, I'm tiptoein', to keep flowin'

At least you'll fall on top of the world

What I'm involved with is deeper than the Masons, baby baby
And it ain't no secret

Options Lyrics[Intro: Pitbull]
Stephen Marley, let 'em know what time it is

[Verse 1: Stephen Marley]
We came here to party, we came here to dance
You know that you're my girl, damn right I'm your man
This night going too good, don't fall for the games
Or the he said, she said dumb shit

[Pre-Chorus: Stephen Marley]
I got a whole lot of names and a whole lot of numbers
But I'll throw them away 'cause I think I might love you
Could be the Mary Jane or the spell that I'm under
But I know what this could be
Tearing up my history for you

[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
I got, I got, I got, I got options
You the, you the, you the, you the top one
So baby, baby, if it ain't a problem
Can I get some of your love?
I got, I got, I got, I got options
You the, you the, you the, you the top one
So baby, baby, if it ain't a problem
Can I get some of your love?
[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Been around the game, been around the fame
Been around the money, been around some names
But the chico's still the same, some things never change
Here's a tip, show me your friends
I'll show you your future, keep the change
I've seen 'em come and go, I've seen 'em sell they souls
You my number one draft pick, baby, let's pick and roll
I always keep you up, up on a pedestal
Misery loves company, baby, don't sweat these hoes

[Pre-Chorus: Stephen Marley]
I got a whole lot of names and a whole lot of numbers
But I'll throw them away 'cause I think I might love you
Could be the Mary Jane or the spell that I'm under
But I know what this could be
Tearing up my history for you

[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
I got, I got, I got, I got options
You the, you the, you the, you the top one

You the, you the, you the, you the top one
So baby, baby, if it ain't a problem

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
They looking for the perfect man
They looking for the perfect life
They take some perfect pics
They want some perfect dick
But there ain't nothing perfect, girl
No such thing as a perfect world
These broads try hard to be
Who they not and not who they are
Baby, you sweating what? Baby, you sweating who?
You talking 'bout such and such who tries to be you?
Man, you JFK, mami, you out your mind
Misery loves company, I'll tell you one more time

[Pre-Chorus: Stephen Marley]
I got a whole lot of names and a whole lot of numbers
But I'll throw them away 'cause I think I might love you
Could be the Mary Jane or the spell that I'm under
But I know what this could be
Tearing up my history for you

You the, you the, you the, you the top one
So baby, baby, if it ain't a problem
Can I get some of your love?
[Bridge: Pitbull]
Baby, you know, you know we got a strong thing
So stop thinking 'bout the wrong things
You know, you know we got a strong thing
So stop thinking 'bout the wrong things

[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
I got, I got, I got, I got options
You the, you the, you the, you the top one
So baby, baby, if it ain't a problem
Can I get some of your love?

While y'all slippin’ he runnin’ the game
Now big bang boogie
Get that kitty little noogie
In a nice, nice little shade

[Pre-Chorus: Pitbull]
I gave Suzie a little pat up on the booty
And she turned around and said “Walk this way”
[Chorus: John Ryan]
I was born in a flame
Momma said that everyone would know my name

Más de la cuenta, no te hagas
Teach me, baby, or better yet
Freak me, baby, yes, yes
I'm freaky, baby
I'ma make sure that your peach feels peachy, baby (Ha, ha, ha)
No bullshit broads, I like my women sexy, classy, sassy
Powerful yes (Yes), they love to get a little bit nasty, ow
This ain't a game you'll see (You'll see)
You can put the blame on me (On me)
Dale, muñequita, abre ahí and let it rain over me (Woo!)
