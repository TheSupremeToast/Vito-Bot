Sex on Fire Lyrics[Verse 1]
Lay where you're layin'
Don't make a sound
I know they're watchin'
They're watchin'
All the commotion
The kiddie like play
Have people talkin'
Talkin'

[Chorus]
You!
Your sex is on fire

[Verse 2]
The dark of the alley
The breakin' of day
Head while I'm drivin'
I'm drivin'
Soft lips are open
Them knuckles are pale
Feels like you're dyin'
You're dyin'

[Chorus]
You!
Your sex is on fire
Consumed!
With what's just transpired
[Verse 3]
Hot as a fever
Rattle of Bones
I could just taste it
Taste it
If it's not forever
If it's just tonight
Oh, we're still the greatest
The greatest, the greatest

[Chorus]
You!
Your sex is on fire
You!
Your sex is on fire, ahh
Consumed!
With what's to transpire
And you!
Your sex is on fire
Consumed!
With what's to transpire59Embed

Use Somebody Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've been roamin' around, always lookin' down at all I see
Painted faces fill the places I can't reach
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you and all you know and how you speak
Countless lovers under cover of the street
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody

[Chorus]
Someone like you

[Verse 2]
Off in the night, while you live it up I'm off to sleep
Wagin' wars to shape the poet and the beat
I hope it's gonna make you notice
I hope it's gonna make you notice

[Chorus]
Someone like me
Someone like me
Someone like me
Somebody

[Bridge]
I'm ready now

I'm ready now
I'm ready now
I'm ready now

WALLS Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can't get there on my own
You can't leave me here alone
I’m just trying to do what’s right
Oh a man ain't a man 'less he's fought the fight
I could never point you out
Waste of space in a faceless crowd
Tell me what I have to say
If you know what’s right, then you’ll walk away

[Chorus]
When the walls come down
When the walls come down
When the walls come down
When the walls come down

[Verse 2]
One by one I've seen em fall
Some just don’t show up at all
I’m just here to fight the fire
Oh a man ain’t a man 'less he has desire

[Chorus]
And the walls come down
And the walls come down
When the walls come down
When the walls come down
[Bridge]
You tore out my heart
And you threw it away
The western girl with eastern eyes
Took a wrong turn and found surprise awaits
Now there’s nothing in the way
In the way
In the way
In the way

[Chorus]
When the walls come down
When the walls come down
When the walls come down
When the walls come down

[Outro]
You tore out my heart
You threw it away
The western girl with eastern eyes
Took a wrong turn and found surprise awaits
Now there’s nothing in the way
In the way
In the way

Waste a Moment Lyrics[Verse 1]
All the way from Waco to WeHo with a rabbit on her chain
Drove a little slick car to tend bar with the static on her brain
She's a little burner, burner, gonna throw you to the flame
Little ticking time bomb, time bomb, gonna blow us all away

[Chorus]
Oh, take the time to waste a moment
Oh, never ask to be forgiven

[Verse 2]
Tex, he was her boyfriend with no kin always running from the law
Every other weekend, the week ends with his back in her claw
He's a livewire, wired, shooting sparks in the night
He’s a gun for a hire, hired with a bead in his sights

[Chorus]
Oh, take the time to waste a moment
Oh, facing where the lines are broken
Oh, name your price to all this living
Oh, never ask to be forgiven

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Oh, take the time to waste a moment
Oh, face it where the lines are broken
Oh, name a price to all that's living
Oh, never ask to be forgiven6Embed

Closer Lyrics[Verse 1]
Stranded in this spooky town
Stop lights are swaying and the phone lines are down
Floor is crackling cold
She took my heart, I think she took my soul
With the moon I run
Far from the carnage of the fiery sun
Driven by the strangle of vein
Showing no mercy, I'd do it again
Open up your eyes
You keep on crying, baby, I'll bleed you dry
Skies are blinking at me
I see a storm bubbling up from the sea

[Chorus]
And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer

[Verse 2]
You who shimmy shook my bone
Leaving me stranded all in love on my own
Do you think of me?
Where am I now? Baby, where do I sleep?
Feels so good, but I'm old
Two thousand years of chasing taking it's toll
[Chorus]
And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer32Embed

Pyro Lyrics[Verse 1]
Single book of matches, gonna burn what's standing in the way
Roaring down the mountain, now they're calling on the fire brigade
Bury all the pictures, and tell the kids that I'm okay
If I'm forgotten, they'll remember me for today

[Chorus]
I, I won't ever be your cornerstone
I, I don't wanna be here holding on

[Verse 2]
All the black inside of me, is slowly seeping from the bone
Everything I cherish, is slowly dying or it's gone
Little shaken babies and drunkards seem to all agree
Once the show gets started it's bound to be a sight to see

[Chorus]
I, I won't ever be your cornerstone
I, I don't wanna be here holding on
I, I won't ever be your cornerstone
I

[Bridge]
Watch her roll, can you feel it?
Watch her roll, can you feel it?
Watch her roll, can you feel it?
Watch her roll, can you feel it?
[Outro]
I, I won't ever be your cornerstone
I, I don't wanna be here holding on (Watch her roll)

I won't ever be your cornerstone

I Want You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Get back on track
Pick me up some bottles of booze
Fickle freshman
Probably thinks she's cooler than you

[Verse 2]
A hay ride at 5
Everybody's coming around
So go press your skirt
Word is there's a new girl in town

[Verse 3]
I call shotgun
You can play your R&B tunes
The fellowship time
It always comes a little too soon

[Verse 4]
The land of the creeps
Freshened up from baby faced shave
Put your eyes on me
And I know a place that we can get away, ay

[Chorus]
Just say I want you
Just exactly like I used to
'Cause baby this is oooo-only bringing me down
[Verse 5]
Home-boy's so proud
He finally got the video proof
The night vision shows
She was only ducking the truth

[Verse 6]
It's heavy, I know
The black cat with the gift down below
A choke and a gag
She spit up an' came back for more, oh ahh ahh

[Chorus]
She said I want you
Just exactly like I used to
And baby this is oooo-only bringing me down

[Post-Chorus]
She said I want you

[Chorus]
I want you
Just exactly like I used to
And baby this is ooo-only bringing me down

Wait for Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Cut open my heart
Right at the scar
And loosen up
Gonna do what I'm told
Go where I'm told
And loosen up
Take a shot in the rain
One for the pain
And loosen up

[Chorus]
I tried all the way
Wait for me, wait for me
It's all better now, it's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me

[Verse 2]
Going to soften the blow
Soften the blow
And give it up
I saw the surprise
The look in your eyes
I gave it up
Gonna be who I am
Be who I am
And give it up
[Chorus]
I tried all the way
Wait for me, wait for me
It's all better now, it's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me
It's all better now, it's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me
It's all better now, it's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me

Beautiful War Lyrics[Verse 1]
Bite your tongue
Don't make a scene, dear
Everybody's been here least once before
We've been here more

Your heart breaks
Rolls down the window
I've seen it all go, come back around
And I've heard the sound

[Chorus]
The tip of your tongue
The top of your lungs is doing my head in
I say, "Love, don't mean nothing
Unless there's something worth fighting for."
It's a beautiful war

[Verse 2]
When I hold
The warmth of your body
There is nobody that I'd rather hold
Shattered and cold

[Chorus]
The tip of your tongue
The top of your lungs is making me crazy
I say, "Love, don't mean nothing
Unless there's something worth fighting for."
It's a beautiful war
I say, "Love, love – it don't mean nothing
Unless there's something worth fighting for."
It's a beautiful war

It's a beautiful war
It's a beautiful war

I say, "Love, love..."
I say, "Love, don't mean nothing
Unless there's something worth fighting for."

I say, "Love, don't mean nothing
Unless there's something worth fighting for."

It's a beautiful war
It's a beautiful war

Supersoaker Lyrics[Verse 1]
My motivation has gone too soon
Good vibrations all over you
Act like you mean it, you mean it
You've got a story you never tell
Down in the delta I'm ringing bells
I've never seen it, seen it
Back of my mind I'm on my way
I see through smiles on every face
I don't believe it, believe it

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm a supersoaker red, white
And blew 'em all away
With the kisses unclean as the words that you say

[Chorus]
I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Miss don't walk away, walk away

[Verse 2]
The flags are flying across the plains
I've got a secret picking at my brain
I wanna see you, see you
The exit sign is on my face
Don't know my home, I don't know my place
I just wanna be there, be there
[Bridge]
'Cause I'm a supersoaker red, white
And blew 'em all away
With the kisses unclean as the words that you say

[Chorus]
I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Miss don't walk away, walk away

[Chorus]
I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Miss don't walk away, walk away

[Chorus 2]
I don't mind sentimental girls at times
I just lay it on the line, on the line

[Chorus]
I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Miss don't walk away, walk away

[Chorus]
I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Miss don't walk away, ooh19Embed
