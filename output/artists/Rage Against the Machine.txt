Bulls on Parade Lyrics[Intro]
Come wit' it now
Come wit' it now

[Verse 1]
The microphone explodes, shattering the mold
Either drop the hits like de la O or get the fuck off the commode
With the sure shot, sure to make the bodies drop
Drop and don't copy, yo, don't call this a co-op
Terror rains drenchin', quenchin' the thirst
Of the power dons, that five-sided Fistagon
The rotten sore on the face of Mother Earth gets bigger
The trigger’s cold, empty your purse

[Chorus]
Rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells

[Verse 2]
Weapons, not food, not homes, not shoes
Not need, just feed the war, cannibal animal
I walk the corner to the rubble, that used to be a library
Line up to the mind cemetery now
What we don't know keeps the contracts alive and movin'
They don't gotta burn the books, they just remove 'em
While arms warehouses fill as quick as the cells
Rally 'round the family, pockets full of shells
[Chorus]
Rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
[Guitar Solo]
Bulls on parade, uh

Wake Up Lyrics[Intro]
Come on
Ugh
Come on

[Verse 1]
Although ya try to discredit, ya still never read it
The needle, I'll thread it, radically poetic
Standin' with the fury that they had in '66
And like E-Double "I'm Mad", still knee deep in the system's shit
Hoover, he was a body remover
I'll give you a dose but it'll never come close
To the rage built up inside of me
Fist in the air in the land of hypocrisy
Movements come and movements go
Leaders speak, movements cease when their heads are flown
'Cause all these punks got bullets in their heads
Departments of police, (What!) the judges (What!), the feds
Networks at work, keeping people calm
You know they went after King when he spoke out on Vietnam
He turned the power to the have-nots
And then came the shot

[Interlude 1]
Yeah
Yeah, back in this
[Verse 2]
With poetry my mind I flex
"Flip" like Wilson, vocals never lackin' that finesse
What do I got to, what do I got to do to wake you up?
To shake you up, to break the structure up?
'Cause blood still flows in the gutter
I'm like taking photos, mad boy kicks open the shutter
Set the groove, then stick and move like I was Cassius
Rep the "Stutter Step" then bomb a left upon the fascists
Yeah, several federal men
Who pulled schemes on the dream and put it to an end
You better beware of retribution with mind war
20/20 visions and murals with metaphors
Networks at work, keepin' people calm
Ya know they murdered X and tried to blame it on Islam
He turned the power to the have-nots
And then came the shot

[Bridge]
What was the price on his head?
What was the price on his head!?
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard, I think I heard a shot
[Interlude 2]
Black Nationalism
[He] may be a brave contender for this position
But should he abandon his supposed 'obedience'
To the 'White liberal doctrine' of non-violence
And embrace Black Nationalism
Through counter-intelligence, it should be possible
To pinpoint potential troublemakers and neutralize them
Through counter-intelligence, it should be possible
To pinpoint potential troublemakers and neutralize them
And neutralize them, and neutralize them
And neutralize them, and neutralize them
And neutralize them

[Chorus]
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!

How long? Not long
'Cause what you reap is what you sow18Embed

Know Your Enemy Lyrics[Intro: Zack De La Rocha]
Huh
Yeah, we're comin' back in with another bombtrack
Think ya know it's all of that, huh
Ayo, so check this out, yeah

[Chorus: Zack De La Rocha]
Know your enemy
Come on

[Verse 1: Zack De La Rocha]
Born with insight and a raised fist
A witness to the slit wrist
As we move into '92
Still in a room without a view
Ya got to know, ya got to know
That when I say go, go, go
Amp up and amplify, defy
I'm a brother with a furious mind
Action must be taken
We don't need the key, we'll break in
Something must be done
About vengeance, a badge and a gun
'Cause I'll rip the mic, rip the stage, rip the system
I was born to rage against 'em
Fist in ya face in the place and I'll drop the style clearly
Know your enemy
[Chorus: Zack De La Rocha]
Know your enemy
Yeah
Ayo, get with this, ugh

[Verse 2: Zack De La Rocha]
Word is born
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Now I got no patience
So sick of complacence
With the D, the E, the F, the I, the A, the N, the C, the E
Mind of a revolutionary, so clear the lane
The finger to the land of the chains
What? The "land of the free"?
Whoever told you that is your enemy
Now something must be done
About vengeance, a badge, and a gun
'Cause I'll rip the mic, rip the stage, rip the system
I was born to rage against 'em
Now action must be taken
We don't need the key, we'll break in

[Bridge: Maynard James Keenan]
I've got no patience now
So sick of complacence now
I've got no patience now
So sick of complacence now
Sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of you
Time has come to pay
[Chorus: Zack De La Rocha]
Know your enemy

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro: Zack De La Rocha]
Come on
Yes, I know my enemies
They're the teachers who taught me to fight me
Compromise, conformity
Assimilation, submission
Ignorance, hypocrisy
Brutality, the elite
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams

Guerrilla Radio Lyrics[Verse 1]
Transmission, third World War, third round
A decade of the weapon of sound above ground
No shelter if you're looking for shade
I lick shots at the brutal charade
As the polls close like a casket
On truth devoured, silent play on the shadow of power
A spectacle, monopolized
The camera's eyes on choice disguised
Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil?
Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?
Yes a spectacle, monopolized
They hold the reins, stole your eyes
All the Fistagons, the bullets and bombs
Who stuff the banks, who staff the party ranks
More for Gore or the son of a drug lord
None of the above, fuck it, cut the cord

[Chorus]
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out, guerrilla radio
[Verse 2]
Contact, I hijacked the frequencies
Blockin' the beltway, move on DC
Way past the days of bombin' MCs
Sound off, Mumia, go on, be free
Who got 'em? Yo, check the federal file
All you pen devils know the trial was vile
Army of pigs try to silence my style
Off 'em all out the box, it's my radio dial

[Chorus]
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up

[Bridge]
It has to start somewhere
It has to start sometime
What better place than here?
What better time than now?

Sleep Now in the Fire Lyrics[Verse 1]
Yeah
The world is my expense
The cost of my desire
Jesus blessed me with its future
And I protect it with fire
So raise your fists and march around
Just don't take what you need
I'll jail and bury those committed
And smother the rest in greed
Crawl with me into tomorrow
Or I'll drag you to your grave
I'm deep inside your children
They'll betray you in my name

[Chorus]
Hey, hey
Sleep now in the fire
Hey, hey
Sleep now in the fire

[Verse 2]
The lie is my expense
The scope of my desire
The party blessed me with its future
And I protect it with fire
[Pre-Chorus]
I am the Niña, the Pinta, the Santa Maria
The noose and the rapist, the fields' overseer
The agents of orange, the priests of Hiroshima
The cost of my desire
Sleep now in the fire

[Chorus]
Hey, hey
Sleep now in the fire
Hey, hey, hey
Sleep now in the fire

[Verse 3]
For it's the end of history
It's caged and frozen still
There is no other pill to take
So swallow the one that makes you ill

[Pre-Chorus]
The Niña, the Pinta, the Santa Maria
The noose and the rapist, the fields' overseer
The agents of orange, the priests of Hiroshima
The cost of my desire
Sleep now in the fire

Bullet in the Head Lyrics[Verse 1]
This time the bullet cold rocked ya
A yellow ribbon instead of a swastika
Nothin' proper about ya propaganda
Fools follow rules when the set commands ya
Said it was blue, when ya blood was red
That's how ya got a bullet blasted through ya head
Blasted through ya head, blasted through ya head
I give a shout out to the living dead
Who stood and watched as the feds cold centralized
So serene on the screen, you was mesmerized
Cellular phones, soundin' a death tone
Corporations cold turn ya to stone before ya realize
They load the clip in, omnicolor
Said they pack the nine, they fire it at prime time
The sleeping gas, every home was like Alcatraz
And mothafuckas lost their minds

[Chorus]
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "how high?" Yeah
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "how high?"
Run it

[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "how high?" Yeah
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "how high?"

[Verse 2]
Checka, checka, check it out
They load the clip in, omnicolor
Said they pack the nine, they fire it at prime time
The sleeping gas, every home was like Alcatraz
And mothafuckas lost their minds
No escape from the mass mind rape
Play it again, Jack, and then rewind the tape
And then play it again, and again, and again
Until ya mind is locked in
Believin' all the lies that they're tellin' ya
Buyin' all the products that they're sellin' ya
They say jump and ya say "how high?"
Ya braindead, ya got a fuckin' bullet in ya head

[Chorus]
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "how high?" Yeah
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "how high?"

Ugh

Ya standin' in line

Ya bowin' down to the flag
Ya got a bullet in ya head

Take the Power Back Lyrics[Intro]
Crank the music up
Bring that shit in, uh
Yeah, the movement's in motion with massive militant poetry
Now check this out, uh

[Verse 1]
In the right light, study becomes insight
But the system that dissed us, teaches us to read and write
So-called facts are fraud
They want us to allege and pledge and bow down to their god
Lost the culture, the culture lost
Spun our minds and through time, ignorance has taken over
Yo, we gotta take the power back
Bam, here's the plan
Motherfuck Uncle Sam, step back, I know who I am
Raise up your ear, I'll drop the style and clear
It's the beats and the lyrics they fear
The rage is relentless
We need a movement with a quickness
You are the witness of change and to counteract
We gotta take the power back

[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on
We gotta take the power back
[Verse 2]
The present curriculum, I put my fist in 'em
Eurocentric, every last one of 'em
See right through the red, white, and blue disguise
With lecture I puncture the structure of lies
Installed in our minds and attempting to hold us back
We've got to take it back
Holes in our spirit causing tears and fears
One-sided stories for years and years and years
I'm inferior? Who's inferior?
Yeah, we need to check the interior
Of the system who cares about only one culture
And that, is why we gotta take the power back

[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on
We gotta take the power back

[Interlude 1]
Ayo check, we're gonna have to break it
Break it, break it down, aw shit

[Guitar Solo]

[Interlude 2]
And like this
Uh! Come on
Yeah, bring it back the other way
Uh
[Verse 3]
The teacher stands in front of the class
But the lesson plan he can't recall
The student's eyes don't perceive the lies
Bouncing off every fucking wall
His composure is well kept
I guess he fears playing the fool
The complacent students sit
And listen to that bullshit that he'd learned in school
Europe ain't my rope to swing on
Can't learn a thing from it, yet we hang from it
(Gotta get it, gotta get it together then
Like the motherfuckin' Weathermen)
Expose and close the doors on those who try
To strangle and mangle the truth
'Cause the circle of hatred continues unless we react
We gotta take the power back

[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on
We gotta take the power back

[Bridge]
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies

Take it back, y'all

Come on, take it back, y'all
Take it back, a-take it back, a-take it back, y'all

Testify Lyrics[Intro]
Uh

[Verse 1]
The movie ran through me
The glamour subdue me
The tabloid untied me
I'm empty. please fill me
Mister Anchor, assure me
That Baghdad is burning
Your voice, it is so soothing
That cunning mantra of killing
I need you, my witness
To dress this up so bloodless
To numb me and purge me now
Of thoughts of blaming you
Yes, the car is our wheelchair
My witness, your coughing
Oily silence mocks the legless ones
Who travel now in coffins

[Pre-Chorus]
While on the corner (Corner)
The jury's sleepless (Sleepless)
We found your weakness (Weakness)
And it's right outside your door
[Chorus]
Now testify
Now testify
It's right outside your door, now testify
Yes, testify
It's right outside your door

[Verse 2]
With precision you feed me
My witness, I'm hungry
Your temple, it calms me, so I can carry on
My slaving, sweating the skin right off my bones
On a bed of fire, I'm choking on the smoke that fills my home
The wrecking ball is rushing
Witness your blushing
The pipeline is gushing
While here we lie in tombs

[Pre-Chorus]
While on the corner (Corner)
The jury's sleepless (Sleepless)
We found your weakness (Weakness)
And it's right outside your door

Now testify
Yeah, testify
It's right outside your door
Now testify

Down Rodeo Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a brown-skinned man
Since their grandparents bought one
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a brown-skinned man
Since their grandparents bought one
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun

[Verse 1]
Bangin' this bolo tight, on this solo flight, can't fight alone
Funk the track, my verbs sly like the Family Stone
Them pen devils set the stage for the war at home
Locked without a wage, you're standing in the drop zone
The clockers born, starin' at an empty plate
Mama's torn hands cover her sunken face
We hungry but them belly full
The structure is set, ya never change it with a ballot pull
In the ruins there's a network for the toxic rock
Schoolyard to precinct, suburb to project block
Bosses rode south for new flesh and a factory floor
The remains left chained to the powder war

[Chorus]
Can't waste a day when the night brings a hearse
So make a move and plead the fifth 'cause ya can't plead the first
Can't waste a day when the night brings a hearse
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a brown-skinned man
Since their grandparents bought one
Yes, I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a brown-skinned man
Since their grandparents bought one
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
[Verse 2]
Yeah
Bear witness to the sickest shot while suckers get romantic
They ain't gonna send us campin' like they did my man Fred Hampton
Still we lampin', still clockin' dirt for our sweat
A ballot's dead, so a bullet's what I get
A thousand years they had the tools, we should be takin' 'em
Fuck the G-ride, I want the machines that are makin' 'em
Our target straight with a room full of armed pawns
To off the Kings on the west side at dawn

[Chorus]
Can't waste a day when the night brings a hearse
Make a move and plead the fifth 'cause ya can't plead the first
Can't waste a day, when the night brings a hearse
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a brown-skinned man
Since their grandparents bought one
Yeah, I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a brown-skinned man
Since their grandparents bought one
Yeah, I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun

Just a quiet, peaceful dance
For the things we'll never have
Just a quiet, peaceful dance
