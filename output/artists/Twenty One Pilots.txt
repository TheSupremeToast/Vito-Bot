Heathens Lyrics[Chorus]
All my friends are heathens, take it slow (In the city, boy, in the city)
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse
All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the room of people who have rooms of people
That they loved one day, locked away
Just because we check the guns at the door
Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades
You’ll never know the psychopath sitting next to you
You’ll never know  the murderer sitting next to you
You'll think, "How'd I get here, sitting next to you?"
But after all I've said, please don't forget

[Chorus]
All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse
[Verse 2]
We don't deal with outsiders very well
They say newcomers have a certain smell
You have trust issues, not to mention
They say they can smell your intentions
You'll never know the freak show sitting next to you
You'll have some weird people sitting next to you
You'll think "How did I get here, sitting next to you?"
But after all I've said, please don't forget
(Watch it, watch it)

[Chorus]
All my friends are heathens, take it slow (In the city, boy, in the city)
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

[Bridge]
All my friends are heathens, take it slow (Watch it)
Wait for them to ask you who you know (Watch it)
Please all my friends are heathens, take it slow (Watch it)
Wait for them to ask you who you know

[Outro]
Why'd you come? You knew you should have stayed (It's blasphemy)
I tried to warn you just to stay away (Wouldn't listen to me)
And now they're outside ready to bust (And guess what?)
It looks like you might be one of us369Embed

Stressed Out Lyrics[Verse 1]
I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think

[Pre-Chorus]
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

[Verse 2]
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter
[Pre-Chorus]
My-my-my name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
[Bridge]
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', "Wake up, you need to make money!," yeah
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', "Wake up, you need to make money!," yeah

[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
[Outro]
We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', "Wake up, you need to make money!," yeah511Embed

Ride Lyrics[Verse 1]
I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
I know it's hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind
I know it's hard sometimes
Yeah, I think about the end just way too much
But it's fun to fantasize
On my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was
But it's fun to fantasize (Size, size)

[Chorus]
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride
Takin' my time on my ride

[Verse 2]
"I'd die for you," that's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them, a bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many bullets comin' through
See many bullets comin' through
Metaphorically, I'm the man
But literally, I don't know what I'd do
"I'd live for you," an' that's hard to do
Even harder to say when you know it's not true
Even harder to write when you know that tonight
There were people back home who tried talking to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions they're for real
Like who would you live for? Who would you die for?
And would you ever kill?
[Chorus]
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride
Takin' my time on my ride

Chlorine Lyrics[Intro: Paul Meany]
So, where are ya? It's been a little while

[Chorus]
Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave, don't save my seat
I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine

[Verse 1]
Lovin' what I'm tastin', woah
Venom on my tongue, dependent at times
Poisonous vibrations, woah
Help my body run

[Refrain]
I'm runnin' for my life
Runnin' for my life

[Chorus]
Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave, don't save my seat
I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine
[Verse 2]
Fall out of formation, woah
I plan my escape from walls they confined
Rebel red carnation, woa-a-oh
Grows while I decay

[Refrain]
I'm runnin' for my life
Runnin' for my life
Yeah, I'm runnin' for my life
Runnin' for my life

[Verse 3]
Hide you in my coat pocket, where I kept my rebel red
I felt I was invincible, you wrapped around my head
Now different lives I lead, my body lives on lead
The last two lines may read incorrect until said
The lead is terrible in flavor
But now you double as a paper maker
I despise you sometimes, I love to hate the fight
And you in my life is like

[Chorus]
Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave, don't save my seat
I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine
[Interlude]
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Beat is a chemical, yeah
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Moment is medical, yeah
Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Beat is a chemical, yeah
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Moment is medical, yeah

[Outro]
I'm so sorry I forgot you
Let me catch you up to speed
I've been tested like the ends of
A weathered flag that's by the sea
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?

East is up, I'm fearless when I hear this on the low
East is up, I'm careless when I wear my rebel clothes
East is up, when Bishops come together they will know that
Dema don't control us, Dema don't control

They want to make you forget
They want to make you forget
Save your razorblades now, not yet
Save your razorblades now, not yet

I'm heavy, my jumpsuit is on steady
I'm lighter when I'm lower, I'm higher when I'm heavy, oh
I'm so high, my Jumpsuit takes me so high
I'm flying from a fire, from Nico and the Niners, oh

What I say when I want to be enough
What a beautiful day for making a break for it
We'll find a way to pay for it
Maybe from all the money we made razorblade stores
Rent a racehorse and force a sponsor
And start a concert, a complete diversion
Start a mob and you can be quite certain
We'll win but not everyone will get out
No, no
We'll win but not everyone will get out
No, no
We'll win but not everyone will get out

East is up, I'm fearless when I hear this on the low

Car Radio Lyrics[Chorus]
I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire, exhale desire
I know it's dire, my time today
I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence

[Verse 1]
Sometimes quiet is violent
I find it hard to hide it, my pride is no longer inside
It's on my sleeve, my skin will scream
Reminding me of who I killed inside my dream
I hate this car that I'm driving, there's no hiding for me
I'm forced to deal with what I feel
There is no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel

[Chorus]
I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence
[Verse 2]
I ponder of something terrifying
'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my, too deep, please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound
There are things we can do
But from the things that work there are only two
And from the two that we choose to do
Peace will win and fear will lose
And there's faith and there's sleep
We need to pick one please because
Faith is to be awake and to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying
To let you know you need to try to think

[Chorus]
I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence
[Bridge]
Woah, oh woah oh
Woah, oh woah oh
Woah, oh woah oh
Woah, oh woah oh
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit

I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire, exhale desire
I know it's dire, my time today
I have these thoughts so often, I ought

Heavydirtysoul Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
There's an infestation in my mind's imagination
I hope that they choke on smoke
'Cause I'm smokin' them out the basement
This is not rap, this is not hip-hop
Just another attempt to make the voices stop
Rappin' to prove nothin', just writin' to say somethin'
'Cause I wasn't the only one who wasn't rushin' to sayin' nothin'
This doesn't mean I lost my dream
It's just right now I got a really crazy mind to clean

Gangsters don't cry, therefore, therefore I'm
Mr. Misty-eyed, therefore I'm (I'm)

Nah, I didn't understand a thing you said
If I didn't know better, I'd guess you're all already dead
Mindless zombies walkin' around with a limp an' a hunch
Sayin' stuff like, "You only live once"
You've got one time to figure it out
One time to twist and one time to shout
One time to think and I say we start now
Sing it with me if you know what I'm talkin' about

Gangsters don't cry, therefore, therefore I'm

That you're alive and have a soul
But it takes someone to come around to show you how

Morph Lyrics[Intro]
Move!

[Verse 1]
Can't stop thinking about if and when I die
For now I see that "if" and "when" are truly different cries
For "if" is purely panic and "when" is solemn sorrow
And one invades today while the other spies tomorrow
We're surrounded and we're hounded
There's no above, or under, or around it
For "above" is blind belief and "under" is sword to sleeve
And "around" is scientific miracle, let's pick "above" and see
For if and when we go above, the question still remains
Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?
And that's when goin' under starts to take my wonder
But until that time, I'll try to sing this

[Chorus]
If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow
I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else
A defense mechanism mode
[Verse 2]
He'll always try to stop me, that Nicolas Bourbaki
He's got no friends close but those who know him most know
He goes by Nico, he told me I'm a copy
When I'd hear him mock me, that's almost stopped me
Well, we're surrounded and we're hounded
There's no above or a secret door
What are we here for
If not to run straight through all our tormentors?
But until that time, I'll try to sing this

[Chorus]
If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow
I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else
A defense mechanism mode
I'll morph to someone else

[Bridge]
Lights, they blink to me, transmitting things to me
Ones and zeroes, ergo this symphony
Anybody listening? Ones and zeroes
Count to infinity, ones and zeroes
I'm surrounded and I'm hounded
There's no above, or under, or around it
For "above" is blind belief and "under" is sword to sleeve
And "around" is scientific miracle, let's pick "above" and see
For if and when we go above, the question still remains
Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?
And that's when goin' under starts to take my wonder
But until that time
