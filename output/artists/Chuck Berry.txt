Johnny B. Goode Lyrics[Verse 1]
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a ringing a bell

[Chorus]
Go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 2]
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by they would stop and say
Oh my, but that little country boy could play

[Chorus]
Go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode
[Verse 3]
His mother told him "Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying 'Johnny B. Goode Tonight'"

[Chorus]
Go, go
Go Johnny go
Go go go, Johnny go
Oh go go, Johnny go
Oh go go, Johnny go
Go, Johnny B. Goode26Embed

You Never Can Tell Lyrics[Verse 1]
It was a teenage wedding
And the old folks wished them well
You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle
And now the young monsieur and madame
Have rung the chapel bell
"C'est la vie", say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

[Verse 2]
They furnished off an apartment with
A two room Roebuck sale
The coolerator was crammed with TV dinners and ginger ale
But when Pierre found work, the little money comin' worked out well
"C'est la vie", say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

[Verse 3]
They had a hi-fi phono, boy, did they let it blast
Seven hundred little records
All rock, rhythm and jazz
But when the sun went down
The rapid tempo of the music fell
"C'est la vie", say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
[Verse 4]
They bought a souped-up jitney, was a cherry red '53
And drove it down to Orleans to celebrate their anniversary
It was there where Pierre was wedded to the lovely madamoiselle
"C'est la vie", say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1]
They had a teenage wedding
And the old folks wished them well
You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle
And now the young monsieur and madame
Have rung the chapel bell
"C'est la vie", say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell7Embed

My Ding A Ling Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I was a little bitty boy
My grandmother bought me a cute little toy
Silver bells hangin' on a string
She told me it was my ding a ling ling

[Chorus]
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I wanna play with my ding a ling

[Verse 2]
When mamma took me to Sunday School
They tried to teach me the golden rule
Every time the choir would sing
I'd sit there and play with my ding a ling

[Chorus]
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I wanna play with my ding a ling

[Verse 3]
When Pa started me to Grammar School
I found a place in the vestibule
And every time the bell would ring
They'd catch me playin' with my ding a ling
[Chorus]
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling

[Verse 4]
Once I was climbing the garden wall
Oh and I had an awful fall
I fell so hard I heard bells ring
But I never let go of my ding a ling

[Chorus]
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling

[Verse 5]
I remember the girl next door
We used to play house on the kitchen floor
She'd be the queen, I'd be the king
Together we'd play with my ding a ling a ling

[Chorus]
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
[Verse 6]
This here song, it is so sad
To those of you who never had
Silver bells hanging on a string
So you could play with your own ding a ling

[Chorus]
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
All come on now, everybody sing
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling (One more time)4Embed

Run Rudolph Run Lyrics[Intro]
Out of all the reindeers, you know you're the mastermind
Run, run Rudolph, Randolph ain't too far behind

[Chorus]
Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run, run Rudolph cause I'm reeling like a merry-go-round

Said Santa to a boy "Child, what have you been longing for?"
"All I want for Christmas is a Rock and Roll electric guitar"

Maybellene Lyrics[Chorus]
Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You done started doing the things you used to do

[Verse 1]
As I was motorvatin' over the hill
I saw Maybellene in a Coupe DeVille
A Cadillac a-rollin' on the open road
Nothin' will outrun my V8 Ford
The Cadillac doin' 'bout ninety-five
She's bumper to bumper rollin' side by side

[Chorus]
Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You've started back doing the things you used to do

[Verse 2]
A Cadillac pulled up to one hundred and four
The Ford got hot and wouldn't do no more
It done got a cloud and started to rain
I tooted my horn for the passin' lane
The rain water blowin' all under my hood
I knew that was doin' my motor good
[Chorus]
Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You done started back doing the things you used to do

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true
You done started back doing the things you used to do

[Verse 3]
The motor cooled down, the heat went down
And that's when I heard that highway sound
The Cadillac a-sittin' like a ton of lead
A hundred and ten a half a mile ahead
The Cadillac lookin' like it's sittin' still
And I caught Maybellene at the top of the hill

[Chorus]
Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You done started back doing the things you used to do4Embed

Well I'mma write a little letter
I'm gonna mail it to my local DJ
Yeah it's a jumping little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven, I gotta hear it again today

You oughta see him reel and rock
Long as she got a dime, the music won't never stop

Memphis, Tennessee Lyrics[Verse 1]
Long distance information, give me Memphis, Tennessee
Help me find the party trying to get in touch with me
She could not leave her number, but I know who placed the call
Because my uncle took the message and he wrote it on the wall

[Verse 2]
Ah, help me, information, get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd phone me here from Memphis, Tennessee
Her home is on the south side, high up on a ridge
Just a half a mile from the Mississippi Bridge

[Verse 3]
Ah, help me, information, more than that I cannot add
Only that I miss her and all the fun we had
But we were pulled apart because her mom did not agree
And tore apart our happy home in Memphis, Tennessee

[Verse 4]
Last time I saw Marie, she was waving me goodbye
With hurry home drops on her cheek that trickled from her eye
Marie is only six years old, information please
Try to put me through to her in Memphis, TennesseeEmbed

No Particular Place to Go Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ridin' along in my automobile
My baby beside me at the wheel
I stole a kiss at the turn of a mile
My curiosity runnin' wild
Cruisin' and playin' the radio
With no particular place to go

[Verse 2]
Ridin' along in my automobile
I's anxious to tell her the way I feel
So I told her softly and sincere
And she leaned and whispered in my ear
Cuddlin' more and drivin' slow
With no particular place to go

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
No particular place to go
So we parked way out on the kokomo
The night was young and the moon was bold
So we both decided to take a stroll
Can you imagine the way I felt?
I couldn't unfasten her safety belt
[Verse 4]
Ridin' along in my calaboose
Still tryin' to get her belt aloose
All the way home I held a grudge
But the safety belt it wouldn't budge
Cruisin' and playin' the radio
With no particular place to go1Embed
