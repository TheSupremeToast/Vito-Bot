WITHOUT YOU Lyrics[Chorus]
You cut out a piece of me and now I bleed internally
Left here without you (No, no, no), without you (Ooh)
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like
Without you (No, no, no), without you (No, no)

[Verse]
I can't believe that you would up and leave me
Fuck all of your reasons
I lost my shit, you know I didn't mean it
Now I see it, you run and repeat it
And I can't take it back, so in the past is where we'll leave it, huh

[Pre-Chorus]
So there you go, oh
Can't make a wife out of a ho, oh
I'll never find the words to say I'm sorry
But I'm scared to be alone

[Chorus]
You cut out a piece of me and now I bleed internally
Left here without you (No, no, no), without you (Ooh)
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like
Without you (No, no, no), without you (No, no)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, woah, oh-oh, woah
Oh-oh, woah, oh-oh, woah
Without you, without you
Oh-oh, woah, oh-oh, woah

[Bridge]
It's gon' be hard here on my own
And even harder to let you go
I really wish that we, could have got this right

[Pre-Chorus]
So here I go, oh
Can't make a wife out of a ho, oh
I'll never find the words to say I'm sorry
But I'm scared to be alone (Oh)

[Chorus]
You cut out a piece of me and now I bleed internally
Left here without you (No, no, no), without you (Ooh)

TELL ME WHY Lyrics[Intro]
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, shit, yeah, yeah)
Late night, thinkin' of shit, um (Yeah)
(Tell me why)
Tell me why, tell me why
It's so hard to say goodbyes
Tell me why, tell me why
(No, no, no, no)
Oh, shit, let's go (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye (Shit)
And when I get inside of my mind, I lose my time
Thinkin' 'bout the times we had to thinkin' 'bout the time we spent
Tell me why you left when you told me this was forever and
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye, yeah

[Verse 1]
Lost too many people to this shit, can't even speak upon this shit
I seen shit, I'm way too damn young, it shouldn't need to be like this
I swear that I'm way too damn numb to even think about this shit
But when it's late and I lay awake, I get to tweakin' in this bitch
Overthinkin', overdrinkin' Hennessy up in this bitch
And I'ma face another 'wood 'til I can't think up in this bitch
'Cause if I keep thinking 'bout our memories
Then it's gon' be in memory of me
[Chorus]
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye (Shit)
And when I get inside of my mind I lose my time
Thinkin' 'bout the times we had to thinkin' 'bout the time we spent
Tell me why you left when you told me this was forever and
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye (Shit)

[Verse 2]
I can't count all the tears I cried, so many sleepless nights
Watched all of my idols die, right in front of my eyes
She asked why my heart so cold, and I just can't even lie
I think that I'm better off, without you with me tonight
Better off alone, 'cause I won't take it well if
You come in my life, just to go like the rest did
Why the fuck does God keep testin' me?
Put my heart to bed, let it rest in pieces

[Chorus]
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye (Shit)
And when I get inside of my mind I lose my time
Thinkin' 'bout the times we had to thinkin' 'bout the time we spent
Tell me why you left when you told me this was forever and
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye, yeah

[Outro]
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye, yeah
And when I get inside of my mind I lose my time
Thinkin' 'bout the times we had to thinkin' 'bout the time we spent
Tell me why you left when you told me this was forever and
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye, yeah73Embed

It's the last time I let you hurt me
Fuck you, goodbye, I did not deserve it
None of this bullshit was ever really worth it
You blame me like I know I ain't perfect
I tried with you, and I lied for you
Many times, put my life on the line for you
I really wanted to get it right with you
I always saw the better side of you
And now it's fuck you for life
I'm doin' better, you right
I was wrong 'bout you, I guess I finally realized
You brought the dark to my light
I'm with a new one tonight
But there is one last thing I want to tell you tonight

Fuck you, goodbye
You hurt me, for the last time
It's time for me to move on

Fuck you, goodbye
You hurt me, for the last time

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Wait, that was a lie
Because I cannot erase you like eternal sunshine in a spotless mind
Red in the eyes, lately I've been on a cocaine diet
I've been tryin' to feed my high
Your things are still in the box that you left in the bedroom
You'll leave, and I'm here
With no heart, guess I'll be dead soon
Ghost in a shell, stoned like a cemetery
Scars don't heal, I got these in February
Broke your spell, love is only temporary
Highway to hell, I'm hangin' out the roof, yellin'

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI, Machine Gun Kelly & Both]
Fuck you, goodbye (Yeah)
You hurt me, for the last time
It's time for me to move on
So fuck you and goodbye
I gave you love and I hate it (Yeah, yeah)

Wish that I was, but you were the cause
For every lil' feelin' I'm feeling inside

I even trusted you, shit, I'm surprised
I'm walkin' away from you, it's about time
Want you to walk out and walk out of my life

You stay on my mind way more than I would like for you to

The reason I can't find no love, don't wanna fight no more

NOT FAIR Lyrics[Intro: Corbin]
I can't cum unless you kiss me
I don't know her but she saying that she miss me
Rolling with that 450
Why they wanna send me under, fucking six feet?
I cope how they want, yeah I keep the safe off
Never out in public 'cause they talk
Got a taste and got shell-shocked
Drive me to Hell in a drop-top

[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]
Uh, drive me to Hell in a drop-top
I need you to save me 'fore I fuck up and go too far
I hate that you blame me for the things that I cannot control
I'm out here tryna make it work for us, it's too much
On my plate, got it all at stake
Say you hate me now, but you're at my place
Tell me lies, tell me that it's all okay
Tell me why you love me, even if it's fake

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI & Corbin]
It's not fair
No matter what, I'm still gon' be here
It's hard for me to show you I care
Crash and burn, Princess Diana
Better off, better off dead
You don't wanna come around here
It's hard for me to show you I care
Don't wanna be myself, I'm too scared
Yeah-yeah, I'm too scared
[Verse 2: Corbin]
Even if it isn't real, I wanna hear it (Oh, Oh)
Pour my heart out on the floor and now it's leaking (Oh, Oh)

I don't care if it was all pretend, I wanna feel it

Bitch, you don't love me, that's a lie, I don't believe it (Nah, nah)
Money make these bitches go insane, yeah, I done seen it (Oh, no)
I don't wanna hear it anymore if you don't mean it
(I don't want, I don't want) Don't wanna fall too deep
Trust issues, it's too hard to give you all of me
Love isn't what you see and what you want it to be
I want you, but I just can't give you all of me

No food in my crib, now I live lavish (Oh, no-no-no)

Them hoes ain't fuck with me back then, now they attracted
FN attached to my bro and he gon' blast it
Don't tell me what I've been through, you don't know
Made it out the mud, with or without you, I'm good
Did it for my lil' bro, just to show him one day you could
I did this for my mama 'cause I told her one day I would

[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]
My life been tragic, thank you for askin'
I've seen too many of my fam end up in caskets
I've seen too many of my friends turned into ashes
Wish I still had them
Light a blunt, put it to the sky, I'm tryna get high (High)
They won't stop, look me in my eyes, tell me it's alright (Alright)
Had to cut plenty people off, money on my mind
I can't fuck with 'em, I can't trust nobody but I (Yeah)

I ain't thinking clear, tell me what I did, I just whipped the Benz
I'd give it all back right now just to see you smile
I'd give my hoes back, on slime, just to hear you now
They ain't my friend, ain't my woadie, ain't my dawg
For to get some money be the only reason that they come around
And the top down, everythin' goin' smoothly
Hope they don't try me, come out on top, I'm shootin' 'round
When I'm up in town
Haters after me but got so many of 'em for me (Yeah), I can't let 'em down
