Hey There Delilah Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hey there, Delilah, what's it like in New York City?
I'm a thousand miles away, but girl, tonight, you look so pretty, yes you do
Times Square can't shine as bright as you
I swear it's true
Hey there, Delilah, don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely, give this song another listen, close your eyes
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise
I'm by your side

[Chorus]
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
What you do to me

[Verse 2]
Hey there, Delilah, I know times are getting hard
But just believe me, girl, someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar, we'll have it good
We'll have the life we knew we would
My word is good
Hey there, Delilah, I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you would take your breath away, I'd write it all
Even more in love with me, you'd fall
We'd have it all
[Chorus]
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me

[Bridge]
A thousand miles seems pretty far
But they've got planes, and trains, and cars
I'd walk to you if I had no other way
Our friends would all make fun of us
And we'll just laugh along because
We know that none of them have felt this way
Delilah, I can promise you
That by the time we get through
The world will never, ever be the same
And you're to blame

[Verse 3]
Hey there, Delilah, you be good and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school and I'll be making history like I do
You'll know it's all because of you
We can do whatever we want to
Hey there, Delilah, here's to you
This one's for you
[Chorus]
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
What you do to me

[Outro]
Ho-oh, whoa-oh, whoa oh-oh oh-oh
Oh-oh, whoa oh-oh oh-whoa
Oh oh-whoa oh-oh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh107Embed

One, two, one, two, three, four
[Verse 1]
Give me more loving than I've ever had
Make it all better when I'm feeling sad
Tell me that I'm special even when I know I'm not
Make it feel good when I hurt so bad
Barely gettin' mad
I'm so glad I found you
I love being around you
You make it easy

There's only one thing (one) to do (two)
Three words (three) for you... (four)

You make it easy

Rhythm of Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
My head is stuck in the clouds
She begs me to come down
Says, "Boy, quit foolin' around"
I told her, "I love the view from up here
Warm sun and wind in my ear
We'll watch the world from above
As it turns to the rhythm of love"

[Chorus]
We may only have tonight
But 'til the morning sun, you're mine
All mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love

[Verse 2]
My heart beats like a drum
A guitar string to the strum
A beautiful song to be sung
She's got blue eyes deep like the sea
That roll back when she's laughing at me
She rises up like the tide
The moment her lips meet mine

[Chorus]
We may only have tonight
But 'til the morning sun, you're mine
All mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love
[Bridge]
When the moon is low
We can dance in slow motion
And all your tears will subside
All your tears will dry

Bop ba (bop ba) bop ba
Bop ba (bop ba) bop ba
Da da da dum da da dum

Bop ba (bop ba) bop ba
Bop ba (bop ba) bop ba
Da da da dum da da dum

[Verse 3]
And long after I've gone
You'll still be humming along
And I will keep you in my mind
The way you make love so fine

[Chorus]
We may only have tonight
But 'til the morning sun, you're mine
All mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love
Oh, play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love
Yeah, sway to the rhythm of love11Embed

The Giving Tree Lyrics[Verse 1]
All the leaves on the Giving Tree have fallen
No shade to crawl in underneath
I've got scars from a pocket knife
Where you carved your heart into me

[Chorus]
If all you wanted was love
Why would you use me up
Cut me down, build a boat, and sail away
When all I wanted to be was your giving tree
Settle down, build a home, and make you happy

[Verse 2]
I lie in the dead of night and I wonder
Whose covers you're between
And it's sad laying in his bed
You feel hollow, so you crawl home back to me

[Chorus]
If all you wanted was love
Why would you use me up
Cut me down, build a boat, and sail away
When all I wanted to be was your giving tree
Settle down, build a home, and make you happy
[Verse 3]
Well, I see a trail that starts
A line of broken hearts behind you
That lead you back to me
The once sad and lonely fool
With nothing left but roots to show, oh

[Chorus]
If all you wanted was love
Why would you use me up
Cut me down, build a boat, and sail away
When all I wanted to be was your giving tree
Settle down, build a home, and make you happy10Embed

Your Body Lyrics[Verse 1]
My favorite pastime is
Getting lost beneath your eyelids
I can't stop staring at you
And lately, my heartbeat's been studying your body
Now I know just what to do

[Chorus]
I don't know nobody
Like I know your body
Every shape, every curve
Every twist and every turn
I don't want nobody
If it ain't your body
I'll keep you forever satisfied, you'll see
'Cause nobody knows your body like me

[Verse 2]
Each freckle, I outline
I'll keep on taking my time
Kissing the space in between (kissing the space in between)
Spend all day admiring
Your dimples when you're smiling
So keep on smiling at me

[Chorus]
I don't know nobody
Like I know your body
Every shape, every curve
Every twist and every turn
I don't want nobody
If it ain't your body
I'll keep you forever satisfied, you'll see
'Cause nobody knows your body like me
[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
I'll ace any pop quiz, baby, with my eyes closed
'Cause I know every inch from your head to your toes

[Chorus]
I don't know nobody
Like I know your body
Every shape, every curve
Every twist and every turn
I don't want nobody
If it ain't your body
I'll keep you forever satisfied, you'll see (oh oh oh oh)
'Cause nobody knows your body like
Nobody knows your body like
Nobody knows your body like meEmbed

Our Time Now LyricsOh oh oh oh

[Verse 1]
There will be no rules tonight
If there were we'd break 'em
Nothing's gonna stop us now
Let's get down to it
Nervous hands and anxious smiles
I can feel you breathing
This is right where we belong
Turn up the music

Oh oh oh oh

[Chorus]
This is the dance for all the lovers
Takin' a chance for one another
Finally it's our time now
These are the times that we'll remember
Breaking the city's heart together
Finally it's our time now
It's our time now

[Verse 2]
This is more than just romance
It's an endless summer
I can feel the butterflies, leading me through it
Take my heart, I'll take your hand
As we're falling under
This is an addiction girl
Let's give in to it
Oh oh oh oh

[Chorus]
This is the dance for all the lovers
Takin' a chance for one another
Finally it's our time now
These are the times that we'll remember
Breaking the city's heart together
Finally it's our time now
It's our time now

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

[Bridge]
Now
It's a dance
Get up
Come on brothers
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

This is the dance for all the lovers
Takin' a chance for one another
Finally it's our time now
These are the times that we'll remember
Breaking the city's heart together
Finally it's our time now

Hate (I Really Donâ€™t Like You) Lyrics[Intro]
Love, love, love, love, love, love
Woo!

[Verse 1]
You were everything I wanted
You were everything a girl could be
Then you left me brokenhearted
Now you don't mean a thing to me

[Pre-Chorus]
All I wanted was your
Love, love, love, love, love, love

[Chorus]
Hate is a strong word
But I really, really, really don't like you
Now that it's over
I don't even know what I liked about you
Brought you around
And you just brought me down
Hate is a strong word
But I really, really, really don't like you

I really don't like you...
[Verse 2]
Thought that everything was perfect
Isn't that how it's supposed to be?
Thought you thought that I was worth it
Now I think a little differently

[Pre-Chorus]
All I wanted was your
Love, love, love, love, love, love

[Chorus]
Hate is a strong word
But I really, really, really don't like you

But I really, really, really don't like you

Now that it's over
You can't hurt me
Now that it's over
You can't bring me down

And you just brought me down

But I really, really, really don't like you

I really don't like you
I really don't like you

A Lonely September Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm sitting here all by myself
Just trying to think of something to do
I'm trying to think of something, anything
Just to keep me from thinking of you
But you know, it's not working out
'Cause you're all that's on my mind
One thought of you is all it takes
To leave the rest of the world behind

[Chorus]
Well I didn't mean for this to go
As far as it did
And I didn't mean to get so close
And share what we did
And I didn't mean to fall in love
But I did
And you didn't mean to love me back
But I know you did

[Verse 2]
I'm sitting here trying to convince myself
That you're not the one for me
But the more I think, the less I believe it
And the more I want you here with me
You know the holidays are coming up
I don't want to spend them alone
Memories of Christmas time with you
Will just kill me if I'm on my own
[Chorus]
Well I didn't mean for this to go
As far as it did
And I didn't mean to get so close
And share what we did
And I didn't mean to fall in love
But I did
And you didn't mean to love me back

[Bridge]
I know it's not the smartest thing to do
We just can't seem to get it right
But what I wouldn't give to have one more chance tonight
One more chance tonight

[Verse 3]
I'm sitting here trying to entertain
Myself with this old guitar
But with all my inspiration gone
It's not getting me very far
I look around my room and everything
I see reminds me of you
Oh please, baby won't you take my hand
We've got nothing left to prove

[Chorus]
Well I didn't mean for this to go
As far as it did
And I didn't mean to get so close
And share what we did
And I didn't mean to fall in love
But I did
And you didn't mean to love me back
But I know you did
And I didn't mean to meet you then
Then when we were just kids
And I didn't mean to give you chills
The way that I kiss
And I didn't mean to fall in love
But I did
And you didn't mean to love me back but I know you did
Don't say you didn't love me back 'cause you know you did
No, you didn't mean to love me back
But you did2Embed

Aud LyricsEvery once in awhile i know
And it probably shows
But every time i look into your eyes
I see a world thats changing more and more
I see world I've never seen before
And i know and i know
When i go to sleep at night
I pull the blankets up tight
I dream of times when i can hold you in my arms
And i will look at you and you at me
And we can be together permanently
And i know and i know
And i know that it must be Audrey
She's the only one for me
And i know and i know
And i know that i must be Audrey
Yeah it must be Audrey
Yeah it must be Audrey
She's the only one for me
She's the only one for me
