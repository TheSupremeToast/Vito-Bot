Say It Ain’t So Lyrics[Intro]
Oh, yeah
Alright

[Verse 1]
Somebody's Heine
Is crowding my icebox
Somebody's cold one
Is giving me chills
Guess I'll just close my eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, yeah
Alright
Feels good
Inside

[Verse 2]
Flip on the telly
Wrestle with Jimmy
Somethin' is bubblin'
Behind my back
The bottle is ready to blow

[Chorus]
Say it ain't so
Your drug is a heartbreaker
Say it ain't so
My love is a life taker
[Verse 3]
I can't confront you
I never could do
That which might hurt you
So try and be cool
When I say
"This way
Is a water slide away from me that takes you further every day"
So be cool

[Chorus]
Say it ain't so
Your drug is a heartbreaker
Say it ain't so
My love is a life taker

[Bridge]
Dear daddy, I write you
In spite of years of silence
You've cleaned up, found Jesus
Things are good, or so I hear
This bottle of Stephen's
Awakens ancient feelin's
Like father, stepfather
The son is drowning in the flood
Yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Say it ain't so
Your drug is a heartbreaker
Say it ain't so
My love is a life taker77Embed

Buddy Holly Lyrics[Verse 1]
What's with these homies dissin' my girl?
Why do they gotta front?
What did we ever do to these guys
That made them so violent?

[Pre-Chorus]
Woo-hoo, but you know I'm yours
Woo-hoo, and I know you're mine
Woo-hoo, that's for all of time

Bang, bang, knock on the door
Another big bang, get down on the floor
Oh no, what do we do?
Don't look now, but I lost my shoe
I can't run and I can't kick
What's a matter, babe, are you feelin' sick?
What's a matter, what's a matter, what's a matter you?
What's a matter, babe, are you feelin' blue? Oh-oh

When you're on a holiday
You can't find the words to say
All the things that come to you
And I wanna feel it too

On an island in the sun
We'll be playing and having fun
And it makes me feel so fine
I can't control my brain

You don't need no memory
Just a place to call your own
As we drift into the zone

And it makes me feel so fine
I can't control my brain

We'll run away together
We'll spend some time forever
We'll never feel bad anymore

Lying on the floor, lying on the floor, I've come undone

El Scorcho Lyrics[Intro: Brian Bell]
¡El Scorcho!
¡Ay, cabrón!

[Verse 1]
Goddamn you half-Japanese girls
Do it to me every time
Oh, the redhead said you shred the cello
And I'm jello, baby
But you won't talk, won't look, won't think of me
I'm the epitome of public enemy
Why you wanna go and do me like that?
Come down on the street and dance with me
[Chorus]
I'm a lot like you, so please
Hello, I'm here, I'm waiting
I think I'd be good for you
And you'd be good for me

[Verse 2]
I asked you to go to the Green Day concert
You said you never heard of them (How cool is that?)
How cool is that? So I went to your room
And read your diary
"Watching Grunge leg drop New Jack through a press table"
And then my heart stopped, "Listening to Cio-Cio San
Fall in love all over again" (Ow)
[Chorus]
I'm a lot like you, so please
Hello, I'm here, I'm waiting (Oh, what could it be now?)
I think I'd be good for you
And you'd be good for me

[Bridge: Rivers Cuomo & Brian Bell]
How stupid is it? I can't talk about it
I gotta sing about it and make a record of my heart
How stupid is it? Won't you gimme a minute?
Just come up to me and say hello to my heart
How stupid is it? For all I know you want me too
And maybe you just don't know what to do
Or maybe you're scared to say
"I'm falling for you"

[Verse 3]
I wish I could get my head out of the sand
'Cause I think we'd make a good team
And you would keep my fingernails clean
But that's just a stupid dream that I won't realize
'Cause I can't even look in your eyes
Without shaking and I ain't faking
I'll bring home the turkey if you bring home the bacon
[Chorus]
I'm a lot like you, so please
Hello, I'm here, I'm waiting (Waiting, oh)
I think I'd be good for you
And you'd be good for me (Oh-hoo)
[Outro: (Matt Sharp) & Rivers Cuomo]
(I'm a lot like you) I'm a lot like you
(I'm a lot like you) I'm waiting, oh
I think I'd be good for you
And you'd be good for me, woo20Embed

Pink Triangle Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I'm stable long enough
I start to look around for love
See a sweet in floral print
My mind begins the arrangements
But when I start to feel that pull
Turns out I just pulled myself
She would never go with me
Were I the last girl on Earth

[Chorus]
I'm dumb, she's a lesbian
I thought I had found the one
We were good as married in my mind
But married in my mind's no good
Oh, pink triangle on her sleeve
Let me know the truth, let me know the truth

[Verse 2]
Might have smoked a few in my time
But never thought it was a crime
Knew the day would surely come
When I'd chill and settle down
When I think I've found a good old-fashioned girl
Then she put me in my place
Everyone's a little queer
Oh, can't she be a little straight?
[Chorus]
I'm dumb, she's a lesbian
I thought I had found the one
We were good as married in my mind
But married in my mind's no good
Oh, pink triangle on her sleeve
Let me know the truth, let me know the truth

[Chorus]
I'm dumb, she's a lesbian
I thought I had found the one, oh
We were good as married in my mind
But married in my mind's no good, oh
Pink triangle on her sleeve
Let me know the truth, let me know the truth
I'm dumb, she's a lesbian
I thought I had found the one, oh
We were good as married in my mind
But married in my mind's no good
Oh, pink triangle on her sleeve
Let me know the truth, let me know the truth
Let me know the truth

Hash Pipe Lyrics[Verse 1]
(Uh) I can't help my feelings, I'll go out of my mind
These players come to get me cause they'd like my behind
I can't love my business if I can't get a trick
Down on Santa Monica where tricks are for kids

[Chorus]
Oh, come on and kick me
Oh, come on and kick me
(Whoa, whoa) Come on and kick me
(Whoa, whoa) You've got your problems
(Whoa, whoa) I've got my eyes wide
(Whoa, whoa) You've got your big G's
I've got my hash pipe

[Verse 2]
(Uh) I can't help my boogies, they get out of control
I know that you don't care but I want you to know
The knee-stocking flavor is a favorite treat
Of men that don't bother with the taste of a teat

[Chorus]
Oh, come on and kick me
Oh, come on and kick me
(Whoa, whoa) Come on and kick me
(Whoa, whoa) You've got your problems
(Whoa, whoa) I've got my eyes wide
(Whoa, whoa) You've got your big G's

Beverly Hills Lyrics[Verse 1]
Where I come from isn't all that great
My automobile is a piece of crap
My fashion sense is a little whack
And my friends are just as screwed as me
I didn't go to boarding schools
Preppy girls never looked at me
Why should they? I ain't nobody
Got nothing in my pocket

[Chorus]
Beverly Hills, that's where I want to be
(Gimme gimme, gimme gimme)
Livin' in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills, rollin' like a celebrity
(Gimme gimme, gimme gimme)
Livin' in Beverly Hills

[Verse 2]
Look at all those movie stars
They're all so beautiful and clean
When the housemaids scrub the floors
They get the spaces in between
I wanna live a life like that
I wanna be just like a king
Take my picture by the pool
Cause I'm the next big thing
[Chorus]
Beverly Hills, that's where I want to be
(Gimme gimme, gimme gimme)
Livin' in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills, rollin' like a celebrity
(Gimme gimme, gimme gimme)
Livin' in Beverly Hills

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
The truth is
I don't stand a chance
It's something that you're born into
And I just don't belong

[Verse 3]
No I don't, I'm just a no class, beat down fool
And I will always be that way
I might as well enjoy my life
And watch the stars play

[Chorus]
Beverly Hills, that's where I want to be
(Gimme gimme, gimme gimme)
Livin' in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills, rollin' like a celebrity

My Name Is Jonas Lyrics[Verse 1]
My name is Jonas, I'm carryin' the wheel
Thanks for all you've shown us, but this is how we feel
Come sit next to me, pour yourself some tea
Just like Grandma made when we couldn't find sleep
Things were better then, once but never again
We've all left the den, let me tell you about it

[Chorus 1]
The choo-choo train left right on time
A ticket cost only your mind
The driver said, "Hey man, we go all the way"
Of course we were willing to pay

[Verse 2]
My name is Wepeel, got a box full of your toys
They're fresh out of batteries, but they're still making noise, making noise
Tell me what to do, now the tank is dry
Now this wheel is flat, and you know what else?
Guess what I received in the mail today
Words of deep concern from my little brother

[Chorus 2]
The building's not goin' as he planned
The foreman has injured his hand
The dozer will not clear a path
The driver swears he learned his math
[Bridge 1]
The workers are going home, the workers are going home
The workers are going home, the workers are going home, yeah

The workers are going home, the workers are going home
The workers are going home, yeah, yeah, yeah

Thank God for Girls Lyrics[Verse 1]
The girl in the pastry shop with the net in her
Hair is making a cannoli for you to
Take on your hiking trip in the woods with your
Bros that you've known since second grade and you
May encounter dragons or ruffians and be
Called upon to employ your testosterone
In a battle for supremacy and access to
Females glued to the TV
And even if you are victorious you may receive
Many cuts, bruises, and scrapes
And you will require band aids and antiseptic ointments
And tender loving kisses on your stab wounds
And when you come home she will be there
Waiting for you with a fire in her eyes
And a big fat cannoli to shove
In your mouth, and that's why you

[Chorus]
Thank God for girls
Holla Jesu Christe, from Tennessee to LA
Thank God for girls
On your reckoning day, you better bow down and pray

[Post-Chorus]
She's so big, she's so strong
She's so energetic in her sweaty overalls
Thank God for girls (Thank God for girls)
Thank God for girls (Thank God for girls), thank God for girls
[Verse 2]
I'm so glad I got a girl to think of
Even though she isn't mine
I think about her all the day and all the night
It's enough to know that she's alive
She says I give her sweaty palms, she almost had a heart attack
The truth is that I'm just as scared I don't know how to act
I wish that I could get to know her better, but meeting up
In real life would cause the illusion to shatter
I carved her name into all the trees
Sang a song down on one knee
Looking at the underwear page of the Sears catalog
Like when I was 14
I'm levitating like a magnet turned
The wrong way around
I'm like an Indian Fakir tryna meditate on a
Bed of nails with my pants pulled down

[Chorus]
Thank God for girls
Holla Jesu Christe, from Tennessee to LA
Thank God for girls
On your reckoning day, you better bow down and pray

[Post-Chorus]
She's so big, she's so strong
She's so energetic in her sweaty overalls
Thank God for girls (Thank God for girls)
Thank God for girls (Thank God for girls), thank God for girls
[Verse 3]
God took a rib from Adam
Ground it up in a centrifuge machine
Mixed it with cardamom and cloves
Microwaved it on the popcorn setting
While Adam was like, "Ooh ooh! That really hurts!"
Going off into the tundra
So pissed at God
And he started lighting minor forest fires, stealing osprey eggs
Messing with the bees who were trying
To pollinate the echinacea, until God said
"I'ma smite you with loneliness
And break your heart in two!"
And Adam wept and wailed
Tearing out his hair
Falling on his knees, looked to
The sky and said, "Thank God..."13Embed
