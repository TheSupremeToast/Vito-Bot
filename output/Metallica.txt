Nothing Else Matters Lyrics[Guitar Intro]

[Verse 1]
So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

[Verse 2]
Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

[Verse 3]
Trust I seek and I find in you
Everyday, for us, something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

[Chorus 1]
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

[Verse 1]
So close, no matter how far
It couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters
[Chorus 1]
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
I never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

[Verse 3]
Trust I seek and I find in you
Everyday, for us, something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

[Chorus 2]
Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play

[Chorus 1]
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know, yeah-yeah!
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
No, nothing else matters

One Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or a dream
Deep down inside, I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

[Chorus]
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, wake me

[Verse 2]
Back in the womb, it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me
[Chorus]
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, wake me

[Short Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Now, the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh, God, help me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, help me
[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Darkness imprisoning me
All that I see, absolute horror
I cannot live, I cannot die
Trapped in myself, body my holding cell
Landmine has taken my sight
Taken my speech, taken my hearing
Taken my arms, taken my legs
Taken my soul, left me with life in Hell

Say your prayers, little one, don't forget, my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in, warm within, keep you free from sin
'Til the Sandman, he comes

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

[Chorus]
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never-never land

Something's wrong, shut the light, heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars, dreams of dragons' fire
And of things that will bite, yeah

Pray the Lord my soul to keep (Pray the Lord my soul to keep)
If I die before I wake (If I die before I wake)
Pray the Lord my soul to take (Pray the Lord my soul to take)
Hush, little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, in your head

[Chorus 2]
Exit light
Enter night
Grain of sand

[Chorus]
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never-never land (yeah, haha haha)

Master of Puppets Lyrics[Verse 1]
End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction

[Refrain]
Taste me, you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you

[Pre-Chorus]
Come crawling faster (Faster)
Obey your master (Master)
Your life burns faster (Faster)
Obey your

[Chorus]
Master, master
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master
[Verse 2]
Needlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror

[Refrain]
Taste me, you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you

[Pre-Chorus]
Come crawling faster (Faster)
Obey your master (Master)

You promised only lies
Laughter, laughter
All I hear or see is laughter
Laughter, laughter
Laughing at my cries
Fix me
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season

I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too
[Pre-Chorus]
Come crawling faster (Faster)
Obey your master (Master)
Your life burns faster (Faster)

The Unforgiven Lyrics[Verse 1]
New blood joins this Earth, and quickly he's subdued
Through constant pained disgrace, the young boy learns their rules
With time the child draws in, this whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts, the young man struggles on and on, he's known
Ooh, a vow unto his own that never from this day
His will they'll take away, yeah

[Chorus]
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free, never me
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"

[Verse 2]
They dedicate their lives to running all of his
He tries to please them all, this bitter man he is
Throughout his life the same, he's battled constantly
This fight he cannot win, a tired man they see no longer cares
The old man then prepares to die regretfully
That old man here is me, yeah
[Chorus]
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free, never me
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"
[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free, never me
So I dub thee "Unforgiven," whoa

[Outro]
Never free, never me
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"
You labeled me, I'll label you
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"
Ah, never free, never me
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"
You labeled me, I'll label you
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"
Never free, never me
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"75Embed

Fade to Black Lyrics[Verse 1]
Life, it seems, will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free

[Verse 2]
Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now he's gone

[Bridge]
No one but me can save myself, but it's too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try
Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye
Goodbye

For Whom the Bell Tolls Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for their right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know

[Chorus]
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

[Verse 2]
Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time you will
Blackened roar, massive roar fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery
Hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see
[Chorus]
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

Hey (Hey), I'm your life, I'm the one who takes you there

They (They), they betray, I'm your only true friend now
They (They), they'll betray, I'm forever there

You (You), you're my mask, you're my cover, my shelter

Hey (Hey), I'm your life, and I no longer care

[Chorus]
I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true
I'm your truth, telling lies
I'm your reasoned alibis
I'm inside, open your eyes
I'm you

Creeping Death Lyrics[Verse 1]
Slaves, Hebrews born to serve
To the Pharaoh
Heed to his every word
Live in fear
Faith of the unknown one
The deliverer
Wait, something must be done
Four hundred years

[Chorus]
So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born Pharaoh son
I'm creeping death

[Verse 2]
Now, let my people go
Land of Goshen
Go, I will be with thee
Bush of fire
Blood, running red and strong
Down the Nile
Plague, darkness three days long
Hail to fire
[Chorus]
So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born Pharaoh son
I'm creeping death

[Bridge]
Die by my hand
(Die) I creep across the land
(Die) Killing first born man
Die by my hand
(Die) I creep across the land
(Die) Killing first born man

I rule the midnight air
The destroyer
Born, I shall soon be there
Deadly mass
I creep the steps and floor
Final darkness
Blood, lamb's blood painted door
I shall pass
[Chorus]
So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born Pharaoh son
I'm creeping death45Embed

Welcome Home (Sanitarium) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labelled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep, my friend, and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says "rage"?

[Chorus]
Sanitarium
Leave me be
Sanitarium
Just leave me alone

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Build my fear of what's out there
Cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?
No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell
[Chorus]
Sanitarium
Leave me be
Sanitarium
Just leave me alone

[Bridge]
Sanitarium
(Just leave me alone)

[Outro]
Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out again30Embed
