Money for Nothing Lyrics[Intro]
I want my...
I want my MTV
I want my...
I want my MTV
I want my...
I want my MTV
I want my...
I want my MTV

[Verse 1]
Now look at them yo-yos, that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Money for nothin' and your chicks for free
Now that ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Lemme tell ya, them guys ain't dumb
Maybe get a blister on your little finger
Maybe get a blister on your thumb

[Chorus]
We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these color TVs
[Verse 2]
See the little faggot with the earring and the makeup?
Yeah buddy, that's his own hair
That little faggot got his own jet airplane
That little faggot, he's a millionaire

[Chorus]
We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these color TVs
Hoover mover, uh

[Chorus]
Gotta install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
He's gotta move these refrigerators
Got to move these color TVs
Looky here, look out

[Verse 3]
I shoulda learned to play the guitar
I shoulda learned to play them drums
Look at that mama, she got it stickin' in the camera
Man, we could have some
And he's up there, what's that? Hawaiian noises?
He's bangin' on the bongos like a chimpanzee
Oh, that ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Get your money for nothin', get your chicks for free
[Chorus]
We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these color TVs

[Verse 4]
Listen here
Now that ain't workin', that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't workin'
That's the way you do it
Money for nothin', and your chicks for free

Chicks for free (I want my MTV)
That ain't workin'

Money for nothin', chicks for free

Sultans of Swing Lyrics[Verse 1]
You get a shiver in the dark
It's raining in the park, but meantime
South of the river
You stop and you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie
Double four time
You feel alright
When you hear the music ring

[Verse 2]
Well, now you step inside
But you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain to hear the Jazz go down
Competition in other places
Ah, but the horns, they blowin' that sound
Way on down south
Way on down south, London town

[Verse 3]
Check out guitar George
He knows all the chords
Mind, it's strictly rhythm
He doesn't want to make it cry or sing
Yes and an old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing
[Verse 4]
And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job – he's doing alright
He can play the Honky Tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans
With the Sultans of Swing

[Verse 5]
And a crowd of young boys
They're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies
And their platform soles
They don't give a damn
About any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call Rock and Roll
And the Sultans
Yeah, the Sultans, they play Creole
Creole

[Guitar Solo - 3:20-4:13]

[Verse 6]
And then the man
He steps right up to the microphone
And says at last
Just as the time bell rings
"Goodnight, now it's time to go home"
Then he makes it fast
With one more thing
"We are the Sultans –
We are the Sultans of Swing"

Romeo and Juliet Lyrics[Verse 1]
A lovestruck Romeo sings the streets a serenade
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
Finds a streetlight, steps out of the shade
Says something like, "You and me babe, how about it?"
Juliet says, "Hey, it's Romeo, you nearly gimme a heart attack"
He's underneath the window
She's singing, "Hey la, my boyfriend's back
You shouldn't come around here singing up at people like that
Anyway, what ya gonna do about it?"
[Chorus 1]
"Juliet, the dice was loaded from the start
And I bet, when you exploded into my heart
And I forget, I forget
The movie song
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong?
Juliet"

[Bridge]
Come up on different streets, they both were streets of shame
Both dirty, both mean, yes and the dream was just the same
And I dreamed your dream for you, and now your dream is real
How can you look at me as I was just another one of your deals?

[Verse 2]
Well you can fall for chains of silver, you can fall for chains of gold
You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
You promised me everything
You promised me thick and thin, yeah
Now you just say, "Oh Romeo, yeah, you know I used to have a scene with him"
[Chorus 2]
"Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
You said I love you like the stars above, I'll love you till I die
There's a place for us
(You know the movie song)
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong?
Juliet"
[Verse 3]
"I can't do the talk like they talk on the TV
And I can't do a love song like the way it's meant to be
I can't do everything, but I'd do anything for you
I can't do anything except be in love with you
And all I do is miss you, and the way we used to be
All I do is keep the beat and the bad company
And all I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme
Juliet, I'd do the stars with you any time"

[Chorus 2]
"Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
You said I love you like the stars above, I'll love you till I die
There's a place for us
(You know the movie song)
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong?
Juliet"
[Outro]
And a lovestruck Romeo sings the streets a serenade
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
Finds a convenient streetlight, steps out of the shade
Says something like, "You and me babe, how about it?"
"You and me babe, how about it?"12Embed

Brothers in Arms Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
These mist covered mountains
Are a home now for me
But my home is the lowlands
And always will be
Some day you'll return to
Your valleys and your farms
And you'll no longer burn
To be brothers in arms

[Verse 2]
Through these fields of destruction
Baptisms of fire
I've witnessed your suffering
As the battle raged higher
And though they did hurt me so bad
In the fear and alarm
You did not desert me
My brothers in arms

[Bridge]
There's so many different worlds
So many different suns
And we have just one world
But we live in different ones
[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Now the sun's gone to hell
And the moon riding high
Let me bid you farewell
Every man has to die
But it's written in the starlight
And every line in your palm
We're fools to make war
On our brothers in arms

Tunnel of Love Lyrics[Instrumental Intro: "The Carousel Waltz"]

[Verse 1]
Getting crazy on the waltzers
But it's the life that I choose
Hey, sing about the sixblade, sing about the switchback
And a torture tattoo
And I've been riding on a ghost train
Where the cars they scream and slam
And I don't know where I'll be tonight
But I'd always tell you where I am
In a screaming ring of faces
I've seen her standing in the light
She had a ticket for the races, yeah
Just like me she was a victim of the night
I put a hand upon the lever
Said: "Let it rock and let it roll"
I had the one arm bandit fever
There was an arrow through my heart and my soul

[Chorus 1]
And the big wheel keep on turning
Neon burning up above
And I'm just high on the world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love
Yeah, love
[Verse 2]
It's just the danger, danger when you're riding at your own risk
She said: "You are the perfect stranger"
She said: "Baby, let's keep it like this"
It's just a cake walk, twisting baby, yeah, step right up and say:
"Hey Mister, give me two, give me two now, 'cos any two can play"

[Chorus 1]
And the big wheel keep on turning
Neon burning up above
And I'm just high on the world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love
Oh, love, love

[Bridge]
Well, it's been money for muscle on another whirligig
Money for muscle and another girl I dig
Another hustle just to, just to make it big
And rockaway, rockaway
Oh, rockaway, rockaway

[Chorus 2]
And girl, it looks so pretty to me
Like it always did
Oh, like the Spanish City to me
When-a we were kids
Hey girl, it looks so pretty to me
Just like it always did
Oh, like the Spanish City to me
When-a we were kids
Check it out!

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
She took off a silver locket
She said: "Remember me by this"
She put her hand in my pocket
I got a keepsake and a kiss
And in the roar of dust and diesel
I stood and watched her walk away
I could have caught up with her easy enough
But something must have made me stay

[Chorus 1]
And the big wheel keep on turning
Neon burning up above
And I'm just high on the world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love
Yeah, love, love, love
On the tunnel of love
Oh, love, love

[Verse 4]
And now I'm searching through these carousels and the carnival arcades
Searching everywhere from steeplechase to palisades
In any shooting gallery where promises are made
To rockaway, rockaway
Rockaway, rockaway
From Cullercoats and Whitley Bay
Out to rockaway
[Chorus 2]
And girl, it looks so pretty to me
Like it always did
Like the Spanish City to me
When we were kids
Girl, it looks so pretty to me
Like it always did
Like the Spanish City to me
When we were kids

Telegraph Road Lyrics[Instrumental intro 0:00-2:16]
[Verse 1]
A long time ago came a man on a track
Walking thirty miles with a sack on his back
And he put down his load
Where he thought it was the best
He made a home in the wilderness
He built a cabin and a winter store
And he plowed up the ground by the cold lake shore
And the other travelers came walking down the track
And they never went further, no
They never went back
[Chorus]
Then came the churches, then came the schools
Then came the lawyers, and then came the rules
Then came the trains and the trucks with their loads
And the dirty old track was the telegraph road
[Verse 2]
Then came the mines, then came the ore
Then there was the hard times, then there was a war
Telegraph sang a song about the world outside
Telegraph road got so deep and so wide
Like a rolling river
[Instrumental break 3:53-4:59]
[Bridge]
And my radio says tonight it's gonna freeze
People driving home from the factories
There's six lanes of traffic
Three lanes moving slow
[Instrumental break 5:15-7:16]
[Verse 3]
I used to like to go to work, but they shut it down
I've got a right to go to work
But there's no work here to be found
Yes, and they say we're gonna have to pay what's owed
We're gonna have to reap
From some seed that's been sowed
[Chorus]
And the birds up on the wires and the telegraph poles
They can always fly away from this rain and this cold
You can hear them singing out their telegraph code
All the way down the telegraph road
[Verse 4]
You know, I'd sooner forget
But I remember those nights
When life was just a bet on a race
Between the lights
You had your head on my shoulder
You had your hand in my hair
Now you act a little colder
Like you don't seem to care
[Chorus]
But believe in me, baby, and I'll take you away
From out of this darkness and into the day
From these rivers of headlights, these rivers of rain
From the anger that lives on the streets with these names
Cause I've run every red light on memory lane
I've seen desperation explode into flames
And I don't want to see it again
From all of these signs saying, "sorry, but we're closed"
All the way
Down the telegraph road

Your Latest Trick Lyrics[Instrumental intro 0:00-1:39]
[Verse 1]
All the late night bargains have been struck
Between the satin beaus and their belles
Prehistoric garbage trucks
Have the city to themselves
Echoes and roars of dinosaurs
They're all doing the monster mash
And most of the taxis and most of the whores
Are only taking calls for cash, mmm

[Chorus]
I don't know how it happened
It all took place so quick
But all I can do is hand it to you
And your latest trick
[Verse 2]
Well now, my door was standing open
Security was laid back and lax
But it was only my heart got-a broken
You must have had a pass key made out of wax
You played robbery with insolence
And I played the blues in twelve bars down on Lovers' Lane
And you never did have the intelligence to use
The twelve keys hanging off of my chain
[Chorus]
I don't know how it happened
It all took place so quick
But all I can do is hand it to you
And your latest trick
[Verse 3]
Well, now it's past last call for alcohol
Past recall has been here and gone
The landlord, he finally paid us all
The satin jazzmen have put away their horns
And we're standing outside of this wonderland
Looking so bereaved and so bereft
Like a Bowery bum when he finally understands
The bottle's empty and there's nothing left, mmm

[Chorus]
I don't know how it happened
It was faster than the eye could flick
But all I can do is hand it to you
And your latest trick

Why Worry? Lyrics[Instrumental intro 0:00-1:13]
[Verse 1]
Baby, I see this world has made you sad
Some people can be bad
The things they do, the things they say
But baby, I'll wipe away those bitter tears
I'll chase away those restless fears
And turn your blue skies into grey

[Chorus]
Why worry, there should be laughter after pain
There should be sunshine after rain
These things have always been the same
So why worry now?
Why worry now?
[Instrumental break 2:22-2:52]
[Verse 2]
Baby, when I get down I turn to you
And you make sense of what I do
I know it isn't hard to say
But baby, just when this world seems mean and cold
Our love comes shining red and gold
And all the rest is by the way
[Chorus]
Why worry, there should be laughter after pain
There should be sunshine after rain
These things have always been the same
So why worry now?
Why worry now?

So Far Away Lyrics[Verse 1]
Here I am again in this mean old town
And you're so far away from me
And where are you when the sun go down?
You're so far away from me

[Chorus]
You're so far away from me
You're so far I just can't see
You're so far away from me
You're so far away from me, alright
[Verse 2]
I'm tired of being in love and being all alone
When you're so far away from me
I'm tired of making out on the telephone
Cause you're so far away from me
[Chorus]
You're so far away from me
You're so far I just can't see
You're so far away from me
You're so far away from me, alright
[Verse 3]
And I get so tired when I have to explain
When you're so far away from me
See, you've been in the sun, and I've been in the rain
And you're so far away from me
[Chorus]
You're so far away from me
You're so far I just can't see
You're so far away from me
