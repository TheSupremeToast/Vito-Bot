Heat Waves Lyrics[Intro]
(Last night, all I think about is you)
(Don't stop, baby, you can walk through)
(Don't want, baby, think about you)
(You know that I'm never gonna lose)
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a—

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 1]
Usually, I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today, I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 2]
You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
[Bridge]
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Outro]

Gooey Lyrics[Verse 1]
Alright, come close
Let me show you everything I know
A jungle slang
Spinning round my head and I stare
While my naked fool
Fresh out of an icky, gooey womb
A woozy youth
Dopes up on her silky, smooth perfume

[Pre-Chorus]
Right my little pooh bear, wanna take a chance?
Wanna sip the smooth air, kick it in the sand?
I’ll say I told you so but you just gonna cry
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes

[Chorus]
My, my simple sir, this ain't gonna work
Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy slurs
I can’t take this place, no I can’t take this place
I just wanna go where I can get some space

[Verse 2]
Truth be told
I've been there, I've done this all before
I take your gloom
I curl it up and puff it into plumes
[Pre-Chorus]
Right my little pooh bear, wanna take a chance?
Wanna sip the smooth air, kick it in the sand?
I’ll say I told you so but you just gonna cry
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes

[Chorus]
My, my simple sir, this ain't gonna work
Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy slurs
I can’t take this place, no I can’t take this place
I just wanna go where I can get some space
[Bridge]
Hold my hand and float back to the summer time
Tangled in the willows, now our tongues are tied
How can I believe you, how can I be nice?
Tripping round tree stumps in your summer smile

[Pre-Chorus]
Right my little pooh bear, wanna take a chance?
Wanna sip the smooth air, kick it in the sand?
I’ll say I told you so but you just gonna cry
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes

[Chorus]
My, my simple sir, this ain't gonna work
Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy slurs
I can’t take this place, no I can’t take this place
I just wanna go where I can get some space109Embed

The Other Side of Paradise Lyrics[Intro]

[Verse 1]
When I was young and stupid my love
Left to be a rock and roll star
He told me: "Please, don't worry"
Wise little smile that spoke so safely
He booked a one-way ticket
Out west, that's where they make it
Six kids stuck in a bedsit
To sunswept poolside riches
He met a girl who wore Versace
Pink feather coats and jumbo jewellery​
Gonna be a hoop phenomenon
He's gonna be Hakeem Olajuwon
He's got a gold Camaro
He said over the payphone
I try to keep my cool but
My life turns in slow motion

[Chorus]
Bye-bye baby blue
I wish you could see the wicked truth
Caught up in a rush, it's killing you
Screaming at the sun you blow into
Curled up in a grip when we were us
Fingers in a fist like you might run
I settle for a ghost I never knew
Super paradise I held on to
But I settle for a ghost
[Verse 2]
Where I was from in NOLA, no one
Left to be a rock and roll star
He'd stay and treat his lady
Give everything to his new baby
I miss him, don't you blame me?
That boy went stone cold crazy
Caught up in camera lust, he's
Chasing that pappy pipe dream

[Bridge]
I know you don't but I-
I know you don't but I still try
My thunder shook him down
My thunder came and shook him down
That girl is gone but I-
That girl is gone but I still try
I think it's over now
The bullet hit but maybe not
I feel so fucking numb
It hits my head and I feel numb
My body's looking wrong
My body's looking wrong
My body's looking wrong

[Chorus]
Bye-bye, baby blue
I wish you could see the wicked truth
Caught up in a rush, it's killing you
Screaming at the sun you blow into
Curled up in a grip when we were us
Fingers in a fist like you might run
I settle for a ghost I never knew
Super paradise I held on to
But I settle for a ghost

Youth Lyrics[Verse 1]
Boy, when I left you you were young
I was gone, but not my love
You were clearly meant for more
Than a life lost in the war

[Pre-Chorus]
I want you to be happy
Free to run, get dizzy on caffeine
Funny friends that make you laugh
And maybe you're just a little bit dappy

[Chorus]
Fly
Feel your mother right at your side
Don't you know you got my eyes
I'll make you fly
You'll be happy all the time
I know you can make it right

[Verse 2]
Boy, now your life is back-to-front
But you'll see that's not for long
'Cause I know you'll feel the ghost
Of some memories so warm
[Pre-Chorus]
Boy, I want you to be happy
Free to run, get dizzy on caffeine
Funny friends that make you laugh
And maybe you're just a little bit dappy

I'll make you fly
You'll be happy all the time

And maybe you're just a little bit dappy

Don't you know you got my eyes
I'll make you fly
You'll be happy all the time
I know you can make it right
I'll make you...

Boy, I want you to be happy
Free to run, get dizzy on caffeine
Funny friends that make you laugh
And maybe you're just a little bit...

Life Itself Lyrics[Verse 1]
Daddy was dumb, said that I’d be something special
Brought me up tough but I was a gentle human
Said that he loved each of my two million freckles
When I grew up was gonna be a superstar

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't get a job so I live with my mum
I take her money but not quite enough
I sit in the car and I listen to static
She said I look fat but I look fantastic

[Chorus]
Come back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Come back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe
Come back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Come back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe

[Verse 2]
I'm waking up, lost in boxes outside Tesco
Look like a bum sipping codeine Coca-Cola
Thought that I was northern Camden's own Flash Gordon
Sonic ray gun, gonna be a superstar
[Pre-Chorus]
I can't get a job so I live with my mum
I take her money but not quite enough
I make my own fun in grandmama's basement
Said I look mad, she said I look wasted

[Chorus]
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe
[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe30Embed

Pork Soda Lyrics[Intro]
Pineapples are in my head
Got nobody 'cause I'm brain-dead
Pineapples are in my head
Got nobody 'cause I'm brain-dead

[Verse 1]
Somewhere in Southend when you were fun
You took my hand and you made me run
Up past the prison to the seafront
You climbed the cliff edge and took the plunge

[Pre-Chorus]
Why can’t we laugh now like we did then?
How come I see you and ache instead?
How come you only look pleased in bed?
Let's climb the cliff edge and jump again (Whoo!)

[Chorus]
Pineapples are in my head
(Pineapples are in my head)
Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead
(Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead)
[Verse 2]
Somebody said I'm a fuckin' slum
Don’t know where I belong
Maybe you’re fucking dumb
Maybe I’m just a bum
Maybe you’re fucking scum
Don’t you go psycho chum
I want you for the world
I want you all the time (stop)
[Chorus]
Pineapples are in my head
(When you were fun)
Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead
(You made me run)
Pineapples are in my head
(To the seafront)
Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead
(She took the plunge)

[Bridge]
Five thousand footsteps in your wet dress
Back to the house with your arms round my neck
We drank pork soda with tangled legs
I won’t forget how you looked at me then
I know I'm no sweet prince of love
Those times that we got drunk
Maybe Jamaica rum
Maybe some Jonnie Dub
Maybe you still think of us
Phone buzz, and still I jump
Why don't I say it then?
I want you all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
Why can’t we laugh now like we did then?
How come I see you and ache instead?
How come you only look pleased in bed?
Let's climb the cliff edge and jump again
[Chorus]
Pineapples are in my head
(Pineapples are in my head)
Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead
(Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead)
Pineapples are in my head
(Pineapples are in my head)
Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead
(Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead)

[Outro]
Pineapples are in my head
(Pineapples are in my head)
Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead
(Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead)
Pineapples are in my head
(Pineapples are in my head)
Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead

Agnes Lyrics[Verse 1]
Agnes, just stop and think a minute
Why don't you light that cigarette and
Calm down now, stop and breathe a second?
Go back to the very beginning
Can't you see what was different then?
You were just popping Percocet
Maybe just four a week at best
Maybe a smoke to clear the head

[Pre-Chorus]
Your head is so numb, that nervous breath you try to hide
Between the motions, that trembling tender little sigh
And so it goes, a choking rose back
To be reborn, I want to hold you like you're mine

[Verse 2]
You see the sad in everything
A genius of love and loneliness and
This time, you overdid the liquor
This time, you pulled the fucking trigger
These days, you're rolling all the time
So low, so you keep getting high
Where went that cheeky friend of mine?
Where went that billion-dollar smile?
[Pre-Chorus]
Guess life is long when soaked in sadness
On borrowed time from Mister Madness
And so it goes, a choking rose back
To be reborn, I want to hold you like you're mine

[Chorus]
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind

Season 2 Episode 3 Lyrics[Chorus]
Don't you need me
Oh baby boy?
'Cause I'm so happy
Without your noise

[Verse 1]
Baby, now my head is on backwards
And my feet at funny angles
And every time I take a step
We're moving forwards faster
And lately, I can't take it
Baby, now my body's intact
And in an ordinary fashion
And everything I tried to leave behind
Is still beside us
And lately, I can't take it

[Pre-Chorus]
Leftover breakfast cereal for lunch
She's broken but she's fun
My girl eats mayonnaise
From a jar while she's getting blazed

[Chorus]
"Don't you need me
Oh baby boy?
'Cause I'm so happy
Without your noise"
[Verse 2]
Lazy, and lying on your belly
With a Super Porp cola
Looking at your phone in clothes
You've worn for three days over
With a cookie as a coaster
Maybe, I wish I could remould you
To vertical and golden
But you turned to Styrofoam
And so it hurts to say it's hopeless
And we ain't gonna make it

[Pre-Chorus]
Leftover breakfast cereal for lunch
She's broken but she's fun
My girl eats mayonnaise
From a jar while she's getting blazed

[Verse 3]
She's drunk on old cartoons
Liquid TV afternoons
Sometimes it makes me laugh
Sometimes it makes me sad

[Chorus]
"Don't you need me
Oh baby boy?
'Cause I'm so happy
Without your noise"
"Don't you need me
You baby boy?
'Cause I'm so happy
Without your noise"

Oh, baby, now my head is on backwards
Mmm, baby, now my head is on backwards
Oh, baby, now my head is on backwards
Mmm, baby, now my head is on backwards

'Cause I'm so happy
Without your noise"26Embed

Take a Slice Lyrics[Intro]
Smells good up here. Yeah, it’s the candle, yo it’s uh… yo it’s uh… Sausage... (Laughter) Sausage candle... Most people don’t do it the way I do it, very personal... So, like, even the money: twenties, twenties, twenties... Y'know, like whatever... I just like sausage-

[Verse 1]
I don't ever wanna pick a slice
One is pretty but the other lies
Chewing on a fat smoke
No filter but you're puffing
Sucking on a slim Vogue
Dark fingernail polish

[Verse 2]
I'm the treasure, baby, I'm the prize
Cut me rails of that fresh cherry pie
Shitty old pistola
Shot a bullet through my wallet
Gonna go to Pensacola
Gonna fuck my way through college

[Chorus]
You've gone with the thick rims
Big look with the lip ring and things
Wake me when the bell rings
I'm gonna sleep 'cause you live in my daydreams
You've gone with the thick rims
Big look with the lip ring and things
Wake me when the bell rings
I'm gonna sleep 'cause you live in my daydreams
[Verse 3]
Sitting pretty in the prime of life
I'm so tasty and the price is right
Stewing in the black dope
I'm filthy and I love it
Studebaker all gold
Got a shotgun in my pocket

[Chorus]
You've gone with the thick rims
Big look with the lip ring and things
Wake me when the bell rings
I'm gonna sleep 'cause you live in my daydreams23Embed

Poplar St Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I was a boy, I lived on Poplar Street
Just a little child with plasters on my knees
Watching all the world from high up in the trees
I saw Mrs Moore sleep 'round with Mr Keats

[Chorus]
I feel like a new man
Red flowers in my bed
Breathe straight through the crisp air
Dead flowers in the sand
I am a true romantic
Free falling love addict, and
I am a true romantic
Free falling love addict, yeah

[Verse 2]
Mama always called that woman prosti-tits
For wearing lower cuts than most and red lipstick
One night Mrs Moore she made her eyes at me
Pulled me through her door and stuck her teeth in deep

[Chorus]
I feel like a new man
Red flowers in my bed
Breathe straight through the crisp air
Dead flowers in the sand
I am a true romantic
Free falling love addict, and
I am a true romantic
Free falling love addict, yeah
[Bridge]
And all your days are gone, sitting on the floor
In your underwear begging me for more
And all my days are gone, sitting on the floor
In my underwear, begging you for more
'Cause

[Chorus]
I am a true romantic
Free falling love addict, and
I am a true romantic
Free falling love addict, yeah

[Outro]
Just another boy who lived on Poplar Street
Tangled up in lust and her exotic needs
One night, Mrs Moore, she called collect to me
"I don't love you anymore," she said and ceased to be
Just another boy
Just another boy
Just another boy12Embed
