Boulevard of Broken Dreams Lyrics[Verse 1]
I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, and I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

[Chorus]
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

[Post-Chorus]
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

[Verse 2]
I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What's fucked up, and everything's all right
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-
[Chorus]
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

[Post-Chorus]
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
I walk alone, I walk a-

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk a-

[Chorus]
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

American Idiot Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't wanna be an American idiot
Don't want a nation under the new media
And can you hear the sound of hysteria?
The subliminal mind-fuck America

[Chorus]
Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
In television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

[Verse 2]
Well, maybe I'm the faggot, America
I'm not a part of a redneck agenda
Now everybody do the propaganda
And sing along to the age of paranoia

[Chorus]
Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
In television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Don't wanna be an American idiot
One nation controlled by the media
Information age of hysteria
It's calling out to idiot America

[Chorus]
Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alien nation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
In television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue135Embed

Holiday Lyrics[Intro]
Say hey!
Cha!

[Verse 1]
Hear the sound of the falling rain
Coming down like an Armageddon flame (Hey!)
The shame, the ones who died without a name
Hear the dogs howling out of key
To a hymn called "Faith and Misery" (Hey!)
And bleed, the company lost the war today

[Chorus]
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday!

[Verse 2]
Hear the drum pounding out of time
Another protester has crossed the line (Hey!)
To find the money's on the other side
Can I get another Amen? (Amen!)
There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (Hey!)
A gag, a plastic bag on a monument

[Chorus]
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday! (Hey!)
[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Three, four!
"The representative from California has the floor."

[Breakdown]
Sieg Heil to the president Gasman
Bombs away is your punishment
Pulverize the Eiffel towers
Who criticize your government
Bang bang goes the broken glass, and
Kill all the fags that don't agree
Trials by fire, setting fire
Is not a way that's meant for me
Just 'cause (Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Just 'cause (Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Because we're outlaws, yeah!

[Chorus]
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
This is our lives on holiday!72Embed

Basket Case Lyrics[Verse 1]
Do you have the time
To listen to me whine
About nothing and everything all at once?
I am one of those
Melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me

[Chorus]
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?

[Verse 2]
And I went to a shrink
To analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
And I went to a whore
He said my life's a bore
So quit my whining 'cause it's bringing her down
[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me

[Chorus]
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Huh yeah, yeah, yeah (Ooh, ooh)

[Bridge]
Grasping to control
So I better hold on

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me

[Chorus]
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?57Embed

Wake Me Up When September Ends Lyrics[Verse 1]
Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Like my father's come to pass
Seven years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends

[Chorus]
Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

[Verse 2]
Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Ring out the bells again
Like we did when spring began
Wake me up when September ends

[Chorus]
Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Like my father's come to pass
Twenty years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends

Good Riddance (Time of Your Life) Lyrics[Intro]
Fuck...

[Verse 1]
Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

[Chorus]
It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life

[Verse 2]
So take the photographs and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories, and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth, it was worth all the while

[Chorus]
It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life

[Violin Solo]

[Chorus]
It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life
It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right

21 Guns Lyrics[Verse 1]
Do you know what's worth fighting for
When it's not worth dying for?
Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocating?
Does the pain weigh out the pride
And you look for a place to hide?
Did someone break your heart inside?
You're in ruins

[Chorus]
One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

[Verse 2]
When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins
[Chorus]
One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

[Bridge]
Did you try to live on your own
When you burned down the house and home
Did you stand too close to the fire?
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Something inside this heart has died
You're in ruins

[Chorus]
One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I86Embed

Jesus of Suburbia Lyrics[Part I: Jesus of Suburbia]

[Verse 1: Billie Joe Armstrong]
I'm the son of rage and love
The Jesus of Suburbia
The bible of "none of the above"
On a steady diet of
Soda-pop and Ritalin
No one ever died for my sins in Hell
As far as I can tell
'Least the ones I got away with

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
And there's nothing wrong with me
This is how I'm supposed to be
In a land of make-believe
That don't believe in me

[Verse 2: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Get my television fix
Sitting on my crucifix
The living room, or my private womb
While the moms and Brads are away
To fall in love and fall in debt
To alcohol and cigarettes and Mary Jane
To keep me insane
Doing someone else's cocaine
[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
And there's nothing wrong with me
This is how I'm supposed to be
In a land of make-believe
That don't believe in me

[Drum Solo]

[Part II: City of the Damned]

[Verse 3: Billie Joe Armstrong]
At the center of the Earth, in the parking lot
Of the 7-Eleven where I was taught
The motto was just a lie
It says "home is where your heart is," but what a shame
'Cause everyone's heart doesn't beat the same
It's beating out of time

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong & Mike Dirnt]
City of the dead (Hey! Hey!)
At the end of another lost highway (Hey! Hey!)
Signs misleading to nowhere
City of the damned (Hey! Hey!)
Lost children with dirty faces today (Hey! Hey!)
No one really seems to care
[Verse 4: Billie Joe Armstrong]
I read the graffiti in the bathroom stall
Like the holy scriptures of the shopping mall
And so it seemed to confess
It didn't say much, but it only confirmed
That the center of the Earth is the end of the world
And I could really care less

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong & Mike Dirnt]
City of the dead (Hey! Hey!)
At the end of another lost highway (Hey! Hey!)
Signs misleading to nowhere
City of the damned (Hey! Hey!)
Lost children with dirty faces today (Hey! Hey!)
No one really seems to care (Hey!)

[Part III: I Don't Care]

[Guitar Solo]

[Intro: Billie Joe Armstrong]
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care
I don't care!
[Verse 5: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Everyone's so full of shit
Born and raised by hypocrites
Hearts recycled, but never saved
From the cradles to the grave
We are the kids of war and peace
From Anaheim to the Middle East
We are the stories and disciples of
The Jesus of Suburbia!

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Land of make-believe
And it don't believe in me
Land of make-believe
(Said it's, it's another lie!)
And I don't believe

[Outro: Billie Joe Armstrong]
And I don't care! (Whoo, whoo, whoo)
I don't care! (Whoo, whoo, whoo)
I don't care! (Whoo, whoo, whoo)
I don't care! (Whoo, whoo, whoo)
I don't care!

[Part IV: Dearly Beloved]

[Verse 6: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Dearly beloved, are you listening?
I can't remember a word that you were saying
Are we demented, or am I disturbed?
The space that's in between insane and insecure

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 7: Billie Joe Armstrong]
(Ooh, ooh) Oh, therapy, can you please fill the void?
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed?
(Ooh, ooh) Nobody's perfect and I stand accused
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) For lack of a better word, and that's my best excuse

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh

[Part V: Tales of Another Broken Home]

[Bass Solo]

[Verse 8: Billie Joe Armstrong]
To live and not to breathe
Is to die in tragedy
To run, to run away
To find what you believe

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
And I leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies

[Verse 9: Billie Joe Armstrong]
I lost my faith to this
This town that don't exist
So I run, I run away
To the lights of masochists

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
And I leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies
And I've walked this line
A million and one fucking times
But not this time!

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge: Billie Joe Armstrong]
I don't feel any shame, I won't apologize
When there ain't nowhere you can go
Running away from pain when you've been victimized
Tales from another broken

Brain Stew Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm having trouble trying to sleep
I'm counting sheep, but running out
As time ticks by, still I try
No rest for cross-tops in my mind

[Refrain]
On my own, here we go

[Chorus]
My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
Dried up and bulging out my skull
My mouth is dry, my face is numb
Fucked up and spun out in my room

[Refrain]
On my own, here we go

[Verse 2]
My mind is set on overdrive
The clock is laughing in my face
A crooked spine, my senses dulled
Past the point of delirium

[Refrain]
On my own, here we go
[Chorus]
My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
Dried up and bulging out my skull
My mouth is dry, my face is numb
Fucked up and spun out in my room

On my own, here we go

Bang Bang Lyrics[Intro]
This is definitely not the first video to surface of an execution
The blue stash of men, they claimed responsibility for the executions
Described as severely mentally disturbed
It appears to show another hostage executed by the terrorist group
Deserve to be annihilated

[Verse 1: Billie Joe Armstrong]
I get my kicks, and I wanna start a rager
I wanna dance like I'm on the video
I got a fever for the violent behavior
I'm sweatin' bullets like a modern Romeo

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong with Mike Dirnt]
Bang! Bang! Gimme fame!
Shoot me up to entertain (Ah-ah)
I am a semi-automatic lonely boy
You're dead! I'm well fed!
Give me death or give me head (Ah-ah)
Daddy's little psycho and Mommy's little soldier

[Verse 2: Billie Joe Armstrong]
I testify like a lullaby of memories
Broadcasting live, and it's on my radio
I got my photobomb, I got my Vietnam
I love a lie just like anybody else

Bang! Bang! Gimme fame!
Shoot me up to entertain (Ah-ah)
I am a semi-automatic lonely boy
You're dead! I'm well fed!

I wanna be a celebrity martyr (Ah-ah)

I wanna be like the soldiers on the screen

For this is love, or it's World War Zero!
