Jump Lyrics[Verse 1]
I get up and nothing gets me down
You got it tough, I've seen the toughest around
And I know, baby, just how you feel
You gotta roll with the punches to get to what's real

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, can't you see me standing here?
I got my back against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Oh, can't you see what I mean?

[Chorus]
Ah, might as well jump (Jump!)
Might as well jump
Go ahead and jump (Jump!)
Go ahead and jump

[Verse 2]
Oh! Hey you! Who said that?
Baby, how you been?
You say you don't know
You won't know until you begin

[Pre-Chorus]
So can't you see me standing here?
I've got my back against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Oh, can't you see what I mean?
[Chorus]
Ah, might as well jump (Jump!)
Go ahead and jump
Might as well jump (Jump!)
Go ahead and jump
Jump!

Panama Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh
Oh yeah
Uh-huh, ah!

[Verse 1]
Jump back, what's that sound?
Here she comes, full blast and top down
Hot shoe, burning down the avenue
Model citizen, zero discipline

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you know she's coming home to me?
You'll lose her in the turn
I'll get her, ah!

[Chorus]
Panama

[Verse 2]
Ain't nothin' like it, her shiny machine
Got the feel for the wheel, keep the moving parts clean
Hot shoe, burning down the avenue
Out an on-ramp coming through my bedroom
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you know she's coming home to me?
You'll lose her in the turn
I'll get her, ah!
Uh-oh

[Spoken Interlude]
Ah
Yeah, we're running a little bit hot tonight
I can barely see the road from the heat coming off it, I say
I reach down between my legs and
Ease the seat back

[Bridge]
She's blinding, I'm flying
Right behind in rearview mirror now
Got the fearing, power steering
Pistons popping, ain't no stopping now

Hot for Teacher Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Spoken]
"Oh wow, man, that's it"
"Wait a second, man
What do you think the teacher's gonna look like this year?"
"My butt, man!"
Oh, uh!
Oh yeah!

[Verse 1]
T-t-teacher, stop that screamin'
Teacher, don't you see?
Don't wanna be no uptown fool
Maybe I should go to Hell, but I'm doin' well
And teacher needs to see me after school

[Pre-Chorus]
I think of all the education that I missed
But then my homework was never quite like this

I've got it bad, so bad
I'm hot for teacher

"I brought my pencil
Gimme something to write on, man!"
Yeah, go

I heard about your lessons, but lessons are so cold
I know about this school
Little girl from Cherry Lawn, how can you be so bold?
How did you know that golden rule?

[Pre-Chorus]
I think of all the education that I missed
But then my homework was never quite like this

Whoa, got it bad, got it bad, got it bad

Fooled me with her style and ease

Atomic Punk Lyrics[Verse 1]
I am a victim of the science age, uh
A child of the storm, whoa yes

For me, time's no more, no more

Nobody rules these streets at night but me

Right Now LyricsDon't wanna wait til tomorrow
Why put it off another day?
One more walk through problems
Built up, and stand in our way, ah
One step ahead, one step behind me
Now you gotta run to get even
Make future plans, don't dream about yesterday, hey
C'mon turn, turn this thing around

[Chorus]
Right now, hey
It's your tomorrow
Right now
C'mon, it's everything
Right now
Catch a magic moment, do it
Right here and now
It means everything

Miss the beat, you lose the rhythm
And nothing falls into place, no
Only missed by a fraction
Slipped a little off your pace, oh
The more things you get, the more you want
Just trade in one for the other
Workin' so hard, to make it easier, whoa
Got to turn, c'mon turn this thing around
[Chorus]

It's enlightened me, right now
What are you waitin' for
Oh, yeah, right now

[Solo]

[Chorus]

Right now, oh, Right now
It's what's happening?
Right here and now
Right now
It's right now
Oh

I’ll Wait Lyrics[Verse 1]
You've got me captured, I'm under your spell
I guess I'll never learn
I have your picture, yes, I know it well
Another page is turned

Are you for real? It's so hard to tell
From just a magazine
Yeah, you just smile and the picture sells
Look what that does to me

[Chorus]
I'll wait till your love comes down
I'm coming straight for your heart
No way you can stop me now
As fine as you are

[Verse 2]
I wrote a letter and told her these words
That meant a lot to me
I never sent it, she wouldn't have heard
Her eyes don't follow me
And while she watches, I can never be free
Such good photography

[Chorus]
I'll wait till your love comes down
I'm coming straight for your heart
No way you can stop me now
As fine as you are
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
You can't imagine what your image means
The pages come alive
Your magic greets everyone who reads
Heartbreak in motor drive

Are you for real? It's so hard to tell
From just a magazine
Yeah, you just smile and the picture sells
Look what that does to me

[Chorus]
I'll wait till your love comes down
I'm coming straight for your heart
No way you can stop me now
As fine as you are

I'll wait till your love comes down
I'm coming straight for your heart
No way you can stop me now
As fine as you are

I'll wait2Embed
