Smells Like Teen Spirit Lyrics[Verse 1]
Load up on guns, bring your friends
It's fun to lose and to pretend
She's over-bored and self-assured
Oh no, I know a dirty word

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello

[Chorus]
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, hey, yay

[Verse 2]
I'm worse at what I do best
And for this gift, I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always will until the end
[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello

[Chorus]
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, hey, yay

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
And I forget just why I taste
Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile
I found it hard, it's hard to find
Oh well, whatever, never mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello
[Chorus]
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido

Heart-Shaped Box Lyrics[Verse 1]
She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak
I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks
I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black

[Chorus]
Hey! Wait! I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey! Wait! I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey! Wait! I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Your advice

[Verse 2]
Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet
Cut myself on angel hair and baby's breath
Broken hymen of 'Your Highness', I'm left black
Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back

[Chorus]
Hey! Wait! I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey! Wait! I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey! Wait! I got a new complaint

Lithium Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm so happy, 'cause today I found my friends, they're in my head

Polly Lyrics[Verse 1]
Polly wants a cracker
I think I should get off her first
I think she wants some water
To put out the blow torch

[Chorus]
Isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip dirty wings
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Got some rope, havenâ€™t told
Promise you, have been true
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself

[Verse 2]
Polly wants a cracker
Maybe she would like some food
She asked me to untie her
A chase would be nice for a few

[Chorus]
Isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip dirty wings
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Got some rope, haven't told
Promise you, have been true
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
[Verse 3]
Polly said
Polly says her back hurts
She's just as bored as me
She caught me off my guard
Amazes me, the will of instinct

[Chorus]
Isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip dirty wings
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Got some rope, haven't told
Promise you, have been true
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself71Embed

In Bloom Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sell the kids for food
Weather changes moods
Spring is here again
Reproductive glands

[Chorus]
He's the one who likes all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun
But he don't knows what it means
Knows what it means, and I say

And he likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means
Knows not what it means, and I say, "Yeah"

We can have some more
Nature is a whore
Bruises on the fruit
Tender age in bloom

He's the one who likes all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means
Knows not what it means, and I say

And he likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means

The Man Who Sold the World Lyrics[Verse 1]
We passed upon the stairs
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend
Which came as a surprise
I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone
A long long time ago

[Chorus]
Oh no, not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

[Verse 2]
I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for foreign land
For years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazely stare
We walked a million hills
I must have died alone
A long, long time ago
[Chorus]
Who knows? Not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

[Chorus]
Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

In the sun, in the sun, I feel as one
In the sun, in the sun

I wish I was like you, easily amused
Find my nest of salt, everything's my fault
I'll take all the blame, aqua seafoam shame
Sunburn, freezer burn, choking on the ashes of her enemy

In the sun, in the sun, I feel as one
In the sun, in the sun
Married, buried

Drain You Lyrics[Verse 1]
One baby to another says, "I'm lucky to have met you"
I don't care what you think unless it is about me
It is now my duty to completely drain you
I travel through a tube and end up in your infection

[Chorus]
Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
I like you

[Verse 2]
With eyes so dilated, I've become your pupil
You taught me everything without a poison apple
The water is so yellow, I'm a healthy student
Indebted and so grateful, vacuum out the fluids

[Chorus]
Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
I like you

You, you, you
You, you, you

Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
Sloppy lips to lips
You're my vitamins
I like you42Embed
