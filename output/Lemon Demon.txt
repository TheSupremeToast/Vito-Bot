The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny Lyrics[Verse 1]
Old Godzilla was hopping around
Tokyo city like a big playground
When suddenly Batman burst from the shade
And hit Godzilla with a bat grenade
Godzilla got pissed and began to attack
But didn't expect to be blocked by Shaq
Who proceeded to open up a can of Shaq-Fu
When Aaron Carter came out of the blue
And he started beating up Shaquille O'Neal
Then they both got flattened by the Batmobile
But before it could make it back to the Batcave
Abraham Lincoln popped out of his grave
And took an AK-47 out from under his hat
Blew Batman away with a rat-a-tat-tat
But he ran out of bullets and he ran away
Because Optimus Prime came to save the day

[Chorus]
This is the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny
Good guys, bad guys and explosions, as far as the eye can see
And only one will survive, I wonder who it will be
This is the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny

[Verse 2]
Godzilla took a bite out of Optimus Prime
Like Scruff McGruff took a bite out of crime
And then Shaq came back covered in a tire track
But Jackie Chan jumped out and landed on his back
And Batman was injured and trying to get steady
When Abraham Lincoln came back with a machete
But suddenly something caught his leg and he tripped
Indiana Jones took him out with his whip
Then he saw Godzilla sneaking up from behind
And he reached for his gun which he just couldn't find
'Cause Batman stole it and he shot and he missed
And Jackie Chan deflected it with his fist
Then he jumped in the air and he did a somersault
While Abraham Lincoln tried to pole vault
Onto Optimus Prime but they collided in the air
Then they both got hit by a Care Bear stare
[Chorus]
This is the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny
Good guys, bad guys and explosions, as far as the eye can see
And only one will survive, I wonder who it will be
This is the ultimate showdown

[Bridge]
Angels sang out an immaculate chorus
Down from the heavens descended Chuck Norris
Who delivered a kick which could shatter bones
Into the crotch of Indiana Jones
Who fell over on the ground, writhing in pain
As Batman changed back into Bruce Wayne
But Chuck saw through his clever disguise
And he crushed Batman's head in between his thighs

[Verse 3]
Then Gandalf the Grey and Gandalf the White
And Monty Python and the Holy Grail's black knight
And Benito Mussolini, and the Blue Meanie
And Cowboy Curtis, and Jambi The Genie
Robocop, The Terminator, Captain Kirk, and Darth Vader
Lo-pan, Superman, every single Power Ranger
Bill S. Preston and Theodore Logan
Spock, The Rock, Doc Ock, and Hulk Hogan
All came out of nowhere lightning fast
And they kicked Chuck Norris in his cowboy ass
It was the bloodiest battle that the world ever saw
With civilians looking on in total awe
The fight raged on for a century
Many lives were claimed but eventually
The champion stood, the rest saw their better
Mr. Rogers in a blood-stained sweater
[Chorus]
This is the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny
Good guys, bad guys and explosions, as far as the eye can see
And only one will survive, I wonder who it will be
This is the ultimate showdown (This is the ultimate showdown)
This is the ultimate showdown (This is the ultimate showdown)
This is the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny30Embed

Two Trucks Lyrics[Intro]
Two trucks having sex
Two trucks having sex
My muscles, my muscles
Involuntarily flex

Two trucks having sex
Two trucks having sex
My muscles, my muscles
Involuntarily flex

[Verse 1]
Two pickup trucks making love
American made, built Ford tough
Two beautiful murder machines
American angels in the sky
Grown men cry

[Chorus]
Two trucks having sex (oh yes)
Two trucks having sex (oh yes)
My muscles (uh!), my muscles (uh!)
Involuntarily flex (huh!)

Two trucks, having sex (oh yes)
Two trucks, having sex (oh yes)
My muscles (uh!), my muscles (uh!)
Involuntarily flex (ha!)
[Verse 2]
Right by my side, there's ZZ Top
And Robert Z'Dar from Maniac Cop 1, 2, and 3
This barbecue could bring you to your knees
And so could these two trucks

[Bridge]
Two trucks holding hands
Two trucks holding hands
The passion, the passion
Is more than I can withstand

Two trucks holding hands
Two trucks holding hands
The passion, the passion
My big fat heart expands

[Verse 3]
Two pickup trucks, one cylinder block
Crush my body like a rock
So beautiful, no stars tonight
Just fireworks and eagles in the sky
The Founding Fathers cry

[Coda]
Two trucks having sex (oh yes)
Two trucks having sex (oh yes)
My muscles (uh!), my muscles (uh!)
Involuntarily flex
Two trucks, having sex (oh yes)
Two trucks, having sex (oh yes)
My muscles (uh!), my muscles (uh!)
Involuntarily! Huh! Flex!
(Ya he ya he ya he ya he ya he ya)

Two trucks having sex
Two trucks having sex
My muscles, my muscles
Involuntarily flex!

Two trucks having sex
Two trucks having sex
My muscles, my muscles
Involuntarily flex!

Two trucks (having sex)
Two trucks (having sex)
Two trucks (having sex, having sex, having sex)

Two trucks (having sex)
Two trucks (having sex)
Two trucks (having sex, having sex, having sex)29Embed

Touch​-​Tone Telephone Lyrics[Verse 1]
I think it's time
For you to know
The awful truth
The truth about me, and the truth about you
'Cause you're a brand new species
Big cat (Uh oh!)
Space Nazis, Robert Stack (Uh oh!)
God damn it, gonna snap (Oh, oh oh oh oh)
Leonard Nimoy, call me back (Call me back!)

[Chorus]
I try to call you every day
I'm rehearsing what to say
When the truth comes out (Of my very own mouth)
I've been working on a unified theory
If I make it through tonight everybody's gonna hear me out
'Cause I'm the right one
On my touch-tone, touch-tone telephone
I'm the only one
On your A.M., A.M. radio

[Verse 2]
Oh, I'm crying now
Authentic tears
They flow out of me when I think about you
'Cause you're the only person in the world who'd understand
'Cause you're the only person in the world who'd understand the meaning of this
Oh my God!
I try and I try and I try (To make you listen to me)
[Chorus]
I try to call you every day
I'm rehearsing what to say
When the truth comes out (Of my very own mouth)
I've been working on a unified theory
If I make it through tonight everybody's gonna hear me out
'Cause I'm the right one
On my touch-tone, touch-tone telephone
I'm the only one (Hey!)
On your A.M., A.M. radio
[Bridge]
(Ooh)
Don't hang up yet, I'm not done
I'm an expert, I'm the one
The one who was right all along
Better to be laughed at than wrong
I'm an expert in my field
UFOlogy, yes, it's all real
Ancient aliens, it's all true
I'm an expert just like you
And like you, I'm a genius before my time
Disbelieving, that's the real crime
Pretty soon they'll discover me
In the Super-Sargasso Sea!
[Chorus]
I try to call you every day
What can I say
When the truth comes out? (Of my very own mouth)
I've been working on a unified theory
If I make it through tonight everybody's gonna hear me out (Now, now, now)
'Cause I'm the right one
(On my touch-tone telephone) On my touch-tone, touch-tone telephone
(I'm the only one on your A.M. radio!) I'm the only one
On your A.M., A.M. radio

Cabinet Man Lyrics[Verse 1]
The day they found me, I hadn't yet been played
Inside my workshop behind the old arcade
Electric desires had unraveled all my wires
Now I'm in a box for safekeeping
The news reporters reported that I died
But all my organs were living on inside
Circuit board to brain with two lungs collecting change
One big human heart gently beeping

[Chorus]
You can't win me, I can't be beat
I won't hurt you, unless you cheat
You can't see me behind the screen
I'm half human and half machine

[Verse 2]
Thank God for business, they let me take the floor
I stood so proudly, like I was going to war
Players soon appeared and I quickly was revered
This must be what love would have felt like
Such dedication, they came from miles away
With eyes so piercing, they'd wait their turn to play
Perfect patient lines, because I was in their minds
I could do whatever I felt like (Whatever I felt like)
[Chorus]
You can't win me, I can't be beat
I won't hurt you unless you cheat
You can't see me behind the screen
I'm half human and half machine

[Bridge]
I'm happy for years and years and
Only eating the occasional maintenance man
Only driving a few kids to madness
Maybe they were predisposed to madness, who knows?
I only want to have fun
But now they're telling me my days here are done
Cause there's a tiny little box they make in Japan
And pretty soon it's gonna fit in your hand
[Verse 3]
It's getting lonely, it's getting hard to breathe
The arcade's empty, I think it's Christmas Eve
Someone's broken in, now they're painting on my skin
Breaking me and taking my quarters
Bashing in my face with a crowbar
Kicking me and pushing me over
Now they see my blood on their sneakers

[Chorus]
You can't win me, I can't be beat
I won't hurt you unless you cheat
You can't see me behind the screen
I'm half human and half machine32Embed

Eighth Wonder Lyrics[Verse 1]
Extra clever
Earthbound spirit
Ghost in the form
Of a mongoose

[Pre-Chorus]
And I have hands
And I have feet
I'll never die
I am a freak

Hello, I'm here
I'm living in the wall

Pillar of salt

And I was born

With such weird noise
And clanking chains

Hello, I'm here
I'm living in the wall

Freak

Jim, let me go
I watch like Hell
[Pre-Chorus]
And I have hands
And I have feet
I'll never die
I am a freak

Hello, I'm here
I'm living in the wall
I know I might be small
But I am the eighth wonder

Eighth wonder of the world
You'll never get to see
What in the name of God can I be?16Embed

Lifetime Achievement Award Lyrics[Verse 1]
Die-hard fans adored your hands
They loved your throat and, quote-unquote, "you"
Hey, remember Michael Jackson?
Michael Jackson really happened
Delta Echo Alpha Delta
Walking on the moon forever

[Chorus 1]
You are dead and buried, you are dead (Oh no)
That's being revised!
Even as we speak we're synthesizing blood and organs
Synthesizing heart and soul
Even Katy Perry knows you're dead (Oh no)
Won't she be surprised!
When we get your heart to start tomorrow
When you see the chart tomorrow you'll be number one

[Verse 2]
Bro, you look amazing!
Really put together
It's like you haven't aged a day
It's like we know what we're doing or something
You've been gone for way too long
Like half a year - an entire career for some
Good luck getting into Heaven
If you live past twenty-seven
Listen to the radiation
Put you back in circulation, oh no!
[Chorus 2]
You are dead and buried, you are dead (Oh no)
Oh, but you never died!
Even as we speak we're synthesizing blood and organs
Synthesizing heart and soul
Ain't no cemetery you can't shed (Oh no)
Ain't nowhere you can hide!
Don't be frightened of us
Soon enough you're gonna love us, just remember
[Bridge]
This is your last ride ever, forever
Fill up your lungs - feel better?
Look - it's you, good as new
New hands, new throat, new living tissue
You earned this new purpose
Lifetime achievement award

[Verse 3]
Don't be nervous, baby
We put a billion eyes back on you
From the grave to the stage
You're unnatural, babe!

[Chorus 1]
You are dead and buried, you are dead (Oh no)
That's being revised!
Even as we speak we're synthesizing blood and organs
Synthesizing heart and soul
Even Katy Perry knows you're dead (Oh no)
Won't she be surprised!
When we get your heart to start tomorrow
When you see the chart tomorrow you'll be number one
(Oh no, oh no)

Sweet Bod Lyrics[Verse 1]
Your body is so sweet now, baby
I'm saying trick or treat now
You know I've got to have you, yeah
You sexy sweet cadaver
All wrapped up like a mummy
I'll cover you in honey
And wait a hundred years or so
You know, you know

[Pre-Chorus]
It isn't sexual (It isn't sexual)
Strictly confectional (Strictly confectional)
Strictly medicinal (Strictly medicinal)
If a little nontraditional

I'm digging up your coffin
And pouring out the contents
Your sexy sweet solution
Is prime for distribution
Sweet bod

[Verse 2]
Your body's starting rumors
Of mason jars of sweetness
Whose satisfied consumers
Have often claimed to witness
Some sexy shrinking tumors
A sweet return to fitness
They're just a hundred bucks or so
You know, you know
[Pre-Chorus]
It isn't sexual (It isn't sexual)
Strictly professional (Strictly professional)
Entrepreneurial (Entrepreneurial)
Oh, and what a sweet memorial

And pouring out the contents
Good God I'm glad to see you
Won't you be my panacea?

When He Died Lyrics[Verse 1]
When he died
Turns out he left behind
A mansion full of other people's skulls
The odd thing is they never found his own
When he died

[Verse 2]
When he died
He somehow left behind
Strange symbols on the floor beneath his corpse
Investigators said the wood was scorched
When he died

[Chorus 1]
When he died
They found so many scorpions inside his lungs
When he died
The statues of his missing children cried
What was later found to be his blood

[Verse 3]
When he died (On a dark and stormy night)
They telephoned his wife (Who reacted with delight)
But gradually her voice began to fade
To nothing, and the Laughing Record played
The Laughing Record played
(laughter)
[Chorus 2]
When he died
They found a message etched into his spine that said:
"When he died
An endless age of untold nightmares would be nigh
And the blood would make the seas run red"

[Verse 4]
When he died (On a dark and stormy night)
A nearby shed caught fire (It simply caught alight)
And when they cleared the charred wood from the ground
Inside they found a painting of a clown
(A creepy painting of a clown)
He'd painted it when he was just a child
But scrawled upon the back
Was exactly when he... died!

[Outro]
When he died
When he died
When he died

No Eyed Girl Lyrics[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, knowing what we know
Knowing what we don't know
This is gonna change our world
Feeling how I feel
I'll accept the unreal
If you'd be my no-eyed girl

[Chorus 1]
From nowhere mankind can go
There's too much light
Blinding white
Your matter tells mine to scatter
It's alri-i-i-ight
It's alright

[Verse]
From the moment that we met, I've been awake
Like I've never been awake in all my life
If I spoke your language, I could tell you how I feel
But your language isn't real
In every myth there's a little bit of truth
But I cannot say a thing, I cannot say a thing
Without proof, oh no

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Knowing what we know
Knowing we do not know
This is gonna change our world
I might go insane
If I learn your full name
If you'd be my no-eyed girl
[Chorus 2]
From nowhere mankind can go
There's too much light
Blinding white
Emotions, human implosions
It's alri-i-i-ight
It's alright

[Bridge]
Right before the kiss I noticed something in the air
Molecules existed when there should have been none there
Chemical reactions with the surface of your skin
Some will say my actions let the no-eyed people in

[Outro]
And I'd do it all again
And I'd do it all again (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
And I'd do it all again (Do it all again)9Embed

Soft Fuzzy Man Lyrics[Verse 1]
Cold and windy
Dark and stormy
Let me float your way
Please don't ignore me

[Chorus]
What you girls really need's a soft, fuzzy man
(An ambient man) A trick of the light to love you tonight
You don't understand, there's nothing quite like a soft, fuzzy man

[Verse 2]
Can't you see me?
Why can't you see me?
I'm all around
All cold and dreamy

[Chorus]
What you girls really need's a soft, fuzzy man
(A wisp of smoke man) To waft over you and cloud up your view
So show me your hands and wave them right through a soft, fuzzy man

[Bridge]
Although I have no arms to hold you in
A human passion burns within me
I need to feel like I exist
So please, baby, please, baby step into the mist
[Verse 3]
Don't be nervous
No, don't be nervous
I'm not like other guys
Who have a surface

[Chorus]
What you girls really need's a soft, fuzzy man
(An atmospheric man) A shimmering puff of indistinct love
What's better than the vague embrace of a soft, fuzzy man?

[Outro]
Who seeps through your thoughts
Who makes you see spots
Who blows through the air
Who plays with your hair
I know it sounds crazy
But once you go hazy, you'll understand
I'm your soft, fuzzy man9Embed
