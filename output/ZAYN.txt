Dusk Till Dawn Lyrics[Verse 1: ZAYN]
Not tryna be indie
Not tryna be cool
Just tryna be in this
Tell me, are you too?
Can you feel where the wind is?
Can you feel it through
All of the windows
Inside this room?

[Refrain: ZAYN]
'Cause I wanna touch you, baby
And I wanna feel you too
I wanna see the sun rise on your sins
Just me and you

[Pre-Chorus: ZAYN & Sia]
Light it up, on the run
Let's make love tonight
Make it up, fall in love, try
(Baby, I'm right here)

[Chorus: ZAYN & Sia]
But you'll never be alone
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here
I'll hold you when things go wrong
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here
[Post-Chorus: ZAYN & Sia]
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here

[Verse 2: ZAYN]
We were shut like a jacket
So do your zip
We would roll down the rapids
To find a wave that fits
Can you feel where the wind is?
Can you feel it through
All of the windows
Inside this room?

[Refrain: ZAYN & Sia]
'Cause I wanna touch you, baby
I wanna feel you too
I wanna see the sun rise on your sins
Just me and you

[Pre-Chorus: ZAYN & Sia]
Light it up, on the run
Let's make love tonight
Make it up, fall in love, try
(Baby, I'm right here)
[Chorus: ZAYN & Sia]
But you'll never be alone
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here
I'll hold you when things go wrong
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here

[Bridge: ZAYN & Sia]
Girl, give love to your body
It's only you that can stop it
Girl, give love to your body
It's only you that can stop it
Girl, give love to your body
It's only you that can stop it
Girl, give love to your body
Girl, give love to your body

[Chorus: ZAYN & Sia]
But you'll never be alone
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here
I'll hold you when things go wrong
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here
[Post-Chorus: ZAYN & Sia]
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here153Embed

Climb on board
We'll go slow and high tempo
Light and dark
Hold me hard and mellow

Entertainer Lyrics[Verse 1]
You thought you had me, didn't you?
When you lied to my face, I could see the truth
Every step of the way I knew
How you fooled me, boo

[Pre-Chorus]
Guess you didn’t know that
You were my favorite entertainer
I'd watch you, I'd laugh, I would fuck with you
Don’t you take me for a fool
In this game, I own the rules
You were my favorite entertainer
I'd watch you, I'd laugh, I would fake it too
Don't you take me for a fool
I'ma show you a thing or two

[Chorus]
Never see me coming, I'll turn you down
When you need me the most, I will turn you
When you need me the most, I will turn you down
Never see me coming, I'll turn you down
When you need me the most, I will turn you
When you need me the most, I will turn you down

[Verse 2]
Thought that you were smarter, I'm ashamed for you
I knew it right away when you stopped lovin’ me
It happened when your touch wasn’t enough for me
[Pre-Chorus]
Thought that you should know that
You were my favorite entertainer
I'd watch you, I’d laugh, I would fuck with you
Don't you play me for a fool
In this game, I own the rules
You were my favorite entertainer
I'd watch you, I'd laugh, I would fake it too
Don’t you play me for a fool
I'ma show you a thing or two

[Chorus]
Never see me coming, I'll turn you down
When you need me the most, I will turn you
When you need me the most, I will turn you down
Never see me coming, I'll turn you down
When you need me the most, I will turn you
When you need me the most, I will turn you down

[Bridge]
Know it's harder to take, and let's face it
No one's playing your games, but let's face it
I'm being straight up
I know fake love when I see it anyway
I'ma turn you down when you need me anyway, anyway, anyway
[Chorus]
Never see me coming, I'll turn you down
When you need me the most, I will turn you
When you need me the most, I will turn you down

Better Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hope I only leave good vibes on your living room floor
It hurts so bad that I didn't when you asked for more
Your dad probably loves me more than he ever did now
'Cause I finally got out
Yeah, we finally knocked down

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause sometimes it's better that way
Gotta let it go so your heart don't break
'Cause I love you
Yeah, baby, I love you
Just this one time, hear what I'm tryna say
Know you might not feel quite the same way
But I love you
I tell you, I love you

[Chorus]
Why? Why wait to fight?
Give it a try
Oh, I say goodbye while it's right
Can we save tears in your eyes?
I'm making you cry
Why wait to hate? Can we save love?

[Verse 2]
I fell in, I'm falling, I'm for you
I can't let you fall through the floor too
It's a gamble to take any more of you
(It's a gamble to take-take more you)
Still in my mind sometimes, I must admit it
Like it's a crime, on trial, I got acquitted
Me and you wasn't meant, we wasn't fitted
Like it's a glove, I hated to admit it
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause obviously, we go back
So why would we ruin that?
In too deep, we're rearranged
Now you wanna ask for names
We can't let this fruit go bad
Sayin' things we can't take back
In too deep, we're rearranged
Say you feel the same

[Chorus]
Why? Why wait to fight?
Give it a try
Oh, I say goodbye while it's right
Can we save tears in your eyes?
And watching you cry
Why wait to hate, can we save love?57Embed

​iT’s YoU Lyrics[Verse 1]
She got, she got, she got her own reasons for talking to me
And she don't, she don't, she don't give a fuck about what I need

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't tell you why because my brain can't equate it
Tell me your lies because I just can't face it

I won't, I won't, I won't cover the scars, I'll let 'em bleed
So my silence, so my silence won't be mistaken for peace

Am I wrong for wanting us to make it?
Tell me your lies because I just can't face it

It's you, it's you, it's you
It's you, it's you it's you
