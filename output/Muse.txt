Uprising Lyrics[Verse 1]
Paranoia is in bloom
The PR transmissions will resume
They'll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed down
And hope that we will never see the truth around
(So come on)

[Verse 2]
Another promise, another seed
Another packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed
And all the green belts wrapped around our minds
And endless red tape to keep the truth confined
(So come on)

[Chorus]
They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious
(So come on)

[Verse 3]
Interchanging mind control
Come let the revolution take its toll
If you could flick a switch and open your third eye
You'd see that we should never be afraid to die
(So come on)
[Verse 4]
Rise up and take the power back
It's time the fat cats had a heart attack
You know that their time's coming to an end
We have to unify and watch our flag ascend
(So come on)

[Chorus]
They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious
(So come on)

[Bridge]
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey

[Chorus]
They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious
(So come on)

I, I can't get these memories
Out of my mind
And some kind of madness
Is starting to evolve, mmmm
And I, I tried so hard to let you go
But some kind of madness
Is swallowing me whole, yeah

[Chorus 1]
I have finally seen the light
And I have finally realised
What you mean

[Verse 2]
Now, I need to know, is this real love
Or is it just madness
Keeping us afloat? Mmm
And when I look back
At all the crazy fights we had
It's like some kind of madness
Was taking control, yeah
[Chorus 2]
Now, I have finally seen the light
And I have finally realised
What you need

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 3]
Now, I have finally seen the end (finally seen the end)
And I'm not expecting you to care, no (expecting you to care)
That I have finally seen the light (finally seen the light)
And I have finally realized (realized)
I need your love
I need your love

[Outro]
Come to me
Just in a dream
Come on and rescue me
Yes I know
I can't be wrong
Baby, you're too headstrong
Our love is...

Pressure Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm trapped and my back's up against the wall
I see no solution or exit out
I'm grinding it out, no one can see
The pressure's growing exponentially
I'm trying to keep up to speed with you
Your lane changing is oscillating me
I'm hitting the ground and I'm sprinting
I'm falling behind now I'm tuning out

Don't stop me (Ah-ah-ah)
Don't choke me (Ah-ah-ah)
I need you out of my head (Don't push me)
You've got me close to the edge (Don't push me)

[Verse 2]
I'm feeling the pressure
I can't break out
No one can hear me scream and shout
Get out of my face, out of my mind
I see your corruption
I'm not blind
I'll carry the burden and take the strain
And when I am done I will make you pay

Starlight Lyrics[Verse 1]
Far away
This ship is taking me far away
Far away from the memories
Of the people who care if I live or die

Until the end of my life

You electrify my life
Let's conspire to ignite
All the souls that would die just to feel alive

If you promise not to fade away

Black holes and revelations
Our hopes and expectations
Black holes and revelations

Mercy Lyrics[Verse 1: Matt Bellamy]
Help me, I've fallen on the inside
I tried to change the game, I tried to infiltrate but now I'm losing
Men in cloaks always seem to run the show
Save me from the ghosts and shadows before they eat my soul
[Chorus]
Mercy
Mercy
Show me mercy, from the powers that be
Show me mercy, can someone rescue me?

[Verse 2]
Absent gods and silent tyranny
We're going under, hypnotized by another puppeteer
And tell me why the men in cloaks always have to bring me down
Running from the ghosts and shadows the world just disavows
[Chorus]
Mercy
Mercy
Show me mercy, from the powers that be
Show me mercy, can someone rescue me?
Show me mercy
Show me mercy, please
[Bridge]
Help me, I've fallen on the inside
And all the men in cloaks trying to devour my soul
[Chorus 2]
Show me mercy from the powers that be
Show me mercy from the gutless and mean
Show me mercy from the killing machines
Show me mercy, can someone rescue me?44Embed

Plug In Baby Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've exposed your lies, baby
The underneath's no big surprise
Now it's time for changing
And cleansing everything
To forget your love

[Chorus]
My plug in baby
Crucifies my enemies
When I'm tired of giving, whoa
My plug in baby
In unbroken virgin realities
Is tired of living

[Verse 2]
Don't confuse
Baby you're gonna lose
Your own game
Change me
And replace the envying
To forget your love

My plug in baby
Crucifies my enemies
When I'm tired of giving, whoa
My plug in baby
In unbroken virgin realities
Is tired of living

Mine is gone
And I've been in trouble

Knights of Cydonia Lyrics[Instrumental Intro with Vocalizations]

Come ride with me through the veins of history
I'll show you a god who falls asleep on the job
And how can we win when fools can be kings?
Don't waste your time, or time will waste you

No one's gonna take me alive
The time has come to make things right
You and I must fight for our rights
You and I must fight to survive
No one's gonna take me alive
The time has come to make things right
You and I must fight for our rights
You and I must fight to survive
