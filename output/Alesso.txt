REMEDY Lyrics[Intro]
O-o-o-o-o-oh
O-o-o-o-o-oh

[Verse 1]
I didn't know that I was broken
Until I found my missing piece
It seemed like every door was closing on me
And you were so far out of reach

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Drunk on the night, you got lips like your wine
I got nothing but time for you
Feeling so high on that look in your eyes
I got nothing but time for you

[Chorus]
(O-o-o-o-o-oh)
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe (O-o-o-o-o-oh)
That loneliness is my disease (O-o-o-o-o-oh)
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe (O-o-o-o-o-oh)
That you are the remedy-y-y-y-y (O-o-o-o-o-oh)
That you are the remedy-y-y-y-y (O-o-o-o-o-oh)
That you are the remedy

[Verse 2]
I didn't have no one to turn to
Yeah, I was circling the drain, mhm
Now you show me I can learn too, yeah
How to be okay again, ooh
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Feeling so high on that look in your eyes
I got nothing but time for you, ooh

[Chorus]
(O-o-o-o-o-oh)
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe (O-o-o-o-o-oh)
That loneliness is my disease (O-o-o-o-o-oh)

Heroes (We Could Be) Lyrics[Verse 1: Tove Lo]
We could hide away in daylight
We go undercover, wait out the Sun
Got a secret side in plain sight
Where the streets are empty, that’s where we run

[Pre-Chorus: Tove Lo]
Everyday people do everyday things but I
Can't be one of them
I know you hear me now, we are a different kind
We can do anything

[Chorus: Tove Lo]
We could be heroes
We could be heroes, me and you
We could be heroes
We could be heroes, me and you
We could be

[Verse 2: Tove Lo]
Anybody’s got the power
They don't see it ‘cause they don't understand
Spin around and round for hours
You and me, we got the World in our hands

[Pre-Chorus: Tove Lo]
Everyday people do everyday things but I
Can't be one of them
I know you hear me now, we are a different kind
We can do anything

We could be heroes
We could be heroes, me and you
We could be heroes
We could be heroes, me and you
We could be

[Chorus: Tove Lo]
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you...
We could be

[Bridge: Tove Lo]
All we're looking for is love and a little light
Love and a little light
(We could be)
All we're looking for is love and a little light
Love and a little light

We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you...

Midnight Lyrics[Verse 1]
Always thought I was losin' the race
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Really don't know how we made it here
Never thought I was worth what you give
Never felt quite alive, now I'm livin'
Yeah, you kill my doubts, they disappear

[Pre-Chorus]
When I feel like nothing's gonna hold me down, hold me down, you do
Used to be scared of fallin', 'til you came around, came around

[Chorus]
Now I just wanna stay here and fall into midnight
Want nobody else now, only you, feel right
Time enjoyed wasted's not wasted time
So stay 'til the morning, stay for a while
I just wanna lay here and fall into midnight
And fall right into you

[Post-Chorus]
And fall right into you

[Verse 2]
Like a rock, I was set in my ways
Always thought I was too far from grace, yeah
I was numb before, but now I feel
Any problem, we'll figure it out
Any love lost, we'll bring back around
Any broken heart, we'll make it heal
[Pre-Chorus]
When I feel like nothing's gonna hold me down, hold me down, you do
Used to be scared of fallin', 'til you came around, came around

[Chorus]
Now I just wanna stay here and fall into midnight
Want nobody else now, only you, feel right
Time enjoyed wasted's not wasted time
So stay 'til the morning, stay for a while
I just wanna lay here and fall into midnight
And fall right into you

[Post-Chorus]
And fall right into you (Oh)
And fall right into you

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, when I feel like nothing's gonna hold me down, hold me down, you do
Used to be scared of fallin', 'til you came around, came around

[Chorus]
Now I just wanna stay here and fall into midnight
Want nobody else now, only you, feel right
Time enjoyed wasted's not wasted time
So stay 'til the morning, stay for a while
I just wanna lay here and fall into midnight
And fall right into you14Embed

I Wanna Know Lyrics[Verse 1: Vinz]
I've been hit by stars
A beauty you are, a beauty you are
Day turns into night
You light up my dark, you light up my dark

And I hope it's the same for you
But you play with my mind when you send me these signs
And I see other guys get 'em too

Hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey
Where do we go, where do we go

Cool Lyrics[Verse 1]
I saw stars on the pavement
California dreams
Looked up through the bright lights
No stars that I see

[Pre-Chorus]
You said, "It's all yours if you take it there"
I said, "I can't do it alone, I swear"
You said, "It's all yours
It's all yours when you smile"

[Chorus]
It's only you (You)
Loves me like you do (Do)
Trying to keep it cool (Cool)
But I can't keep cool about it
Acted like a fool (Fool)
Wanna scream it from the roof (Roof)
I'm trying to keep it cool (Cool)
But I can't keep cool about it ('Bout it)
Can't keep cool about it ('Bout it)
Can't keep cool about it ('Bout it)

[Verse 2]
Before you, love, I was lost
Drifting at sea
You were the beacon I followed home
You were the one that rescued me
[Pre-Chorus]
You said, "It's all yours if you take it there"
I said, "I can't do it alone, I swear"
You said, "It's all yours
It's all yours when you smile"

It's only you (You)
Loves me like you do (Do)

Sweet Escape Lyrics[Verse 1]
We drive so far to get away, never look back
We don't care about nothing else
A sweet escape, gotta break free
Like a shooting star, let the skyline guide us

[Pre-Chorus]
We don't care about nothing else
A sweet escape, feels like heaven
Nothing can stop us now

[Chorus]
We run away, a sweet escape
Nothing can hold us down
Just like a wave that never breaks
Nothing can stop us now
And if you fall, I'll pick you up
I'll follow you to the end of time
We run away, a sweet escape
Nothing can stop us now

[Post-Chorus]
Nothing can stop us now
Nothing can stop us now

Nothing can stop us now

All lights go out and fade away, never lose faith
Leave all of your fears behind
A sweet escape, gotta break free
With an open heart, let the sunshine find us

We don't care about nothing else
A sweet escape, feels like heaven
Nothing can stop us now

We run away, a sweet escape
Nothing can hold us down
Just like a wave that never breaks

And if you fall, I'll pick you up

Nothing can stop us now

Body high, swimming in my bed
We ignite, we're slipping like sand

Sad Song Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'll go to the moon just to get close to you
But sitting in your room, I feel so far, far, far away
You know what to do to pull me into you
’Cause every time you move, you take my breath, breath, breath away

[Pre-Chorus]
And when I hear you, oh
Suddenly off my feet
So will you come through? Oh
And I'll play you on repeat, ooh

[Chorus]
You're singing a sad song, but you make it sound happy
You got the perfect words to hurt me so, hurt me so good
You’re singing a sad song, but you make it sound happy
You're playing my heart and I'm falling apart just like I knew I would

[Verse 2]
Tell me why I save every last dance for you
And everything you say, I memori-i-ize it all
You know how to get me higher even when I wanna cry
But you're setting me on fire just to warm, warm, warm you up

And when I hear you, oh
Suddenly off my feet
So will you come through? Oh
And I'll play you on repeat, ooh

You got the perfect words to hurt me so, hurt me so good
You're singing a sad song but you make it sound happy
You're playing my heart and I’m falling apart just like I knew I would

[Post-Chorus]
Everything about you kinda makes it sound happy
How many words for you to hurt me so, hurt me so good
Everything about you kinda makes it sound happy
I’m falling apart just, falling apart just like I knew you would

Hear you deep inside of me
Your back and forth is slowly killing me
Don't just leave me quietly
Play your song and keep convincing me

You’re singing a sad song but you make it sound happy
You got the perfect words to hurt me so, hurt me so good
You're singing a sad song but you make it sound happy

If It Wasn’t For You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was alone
I was made of stone, you took me home
We built a world, a world for us
We flew like birds, a new beginning

[Chorus]
It’s better, better, better
You keeping me together, gether, gether
You know that I will never, never, never
Try to pull you down, down
Lover, lover, lover you can always be here
I’ll take cover
You know that I will never, never, never
Leave you all alone
I’d be nothing if it wasn't for you
If it wasn't for you

[Verse 2]
I was a fool always keeping a distance
If I’d ever know, oh
You found a way, I thought I always stayed the same
Because of you, I saw a new beginning

[Chorus]
It’s better, better, better
You keeping me together, gether, gether
You know that I will never, never, never
Try to pull you down, down
Lover, lover, lover you can always be here
I’ll take cover
You know that I will never, never, never
Leave you all alone
I’d be nothing if it wasn't for you
If it wasn't for you
If it wasn't for you
If it wasn't for you2Embed
