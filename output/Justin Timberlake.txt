Mirrors Lyrics[Verse 1]
Aren't you somethin' to admire?
'Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
And I can't help but notice
You reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and
The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always
Parallel on the other side

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'll be there to pull you through
You just gotta be strong

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror staring back at me  (Oh)
I couldn't get any bigger (Oh)
With anyone else beside me (Oh)
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me
[Verse 2]
Aren't you somethin', an original?
'Cause it doesn't seem merely assembled
And I can't help but stare, 'cause
I see truth somewhere in your eyes
I can't ever change without you
You reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could, I
Would look at us all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the past
I'm here tryna pull you through
You just gotta be strong

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror staring back at me (Oh)
I couldn't get any bigger (Oh)
With anyone else beside me (Oh)
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me
[Bridge]
Yesterday is history, oh
Tomorrow's a mystery, oh
I can see you lookin' back at me
Keep your eyes on me
Baby, keep your eyes on me

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now (You show me, baby)
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror staring back at me (Oh)
I couldn't get any bigger (Oh)
With anyone else beside me (Oh)
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me
[Post-Chorus]
Ohh (Oh oh, oh oh)
Ohh (Oh oh, oh oh)
Ohh ohh (Oh oh, oh oh)
Uhh (Oh oh, oh oh)
Ohh (Oh oh, oh oh)

Suit & Tie Lyrics[Intro: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
Ooh-oh
I be on my suit and tie, shit tied, shit tied
I be on my suit and tie, shit tied, shit
Can I show you a few things?
A few things, a few things, little baby
'Cause I be on my suit and tie, shit tied, shit
I be on my suit and tie, shit tied, shit
Let me show you a few things
Let me show you a few things
Wait a minute
You ready, JT?

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
I can't wait 'til I get you on the floor, good-lookin'
Going hot, so hot, just like an oven
And ow! Burned myself, but just had to touch it
And it's so fine, and it's all mine
Hey, baby, we don't mind all the watchin' (High)
'Cause if they study close, real close
They might learn somethin'
She ain't nothin' but a little doozy when she does it
She's so fire tonight

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And as long as I've got my suit and tie
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things (Show you a few things)
All pressed up in black and white
And you're dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things (Show you a few things)
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love
Now we’re in the swing of love
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things
Show you a few things about love, hey
[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Stop, let me get a good look at it
So thick, now I know why they call it a fatty
And ow!
Shit so sick got a hit and picked up a habit
That's alright, 'cause you're all mine (You're all mine)
Go on and show 'em who you call daddy
I guess they're just mad
'Cause, girl, they wish they had it
My killer, my Thriller, yeah, you're a classic
And you're all mine, tonight

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And as long as I've got my suit and tie
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things
All pressed up in black and white
And you're dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love
Now we’re in the swing of love
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love, hey
[Interlude: Justin Timberlake]
Get out your seat, Hov!

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Uh!
All black at the white shows
White shoes at the black shows
Green card for the Cuban links
Y'all sit back and enjoy the light show
Nothing exceeds like excess
Stoute got gout from having the best of the best
Is this what it's all about? I'm at the rest-
-aurant with my rant disturbing the guests
Years of distress, tears on the dress
Try to hide her face with some makeup sex
Uh!
This is truffle season
Tom Ford tuxedos for no reason
All Saints for my angel, Alexander Wang too
Ass-tight denim and some Dunks
I'll show you how to do this young, uh!
No papers, catch vapors
Get high, out Vegas
D'USSÉ's on doubles, ain't looking for trouble
You just got good genes so a nigga tryna cuff you
Tell your mother that I love her 'cause I love you
Tell your father we go farther as a couple
They ain't lose a daughter, got a son
I show you how to do this, huh! Uh
[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And as long as I've got my suit and tie
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things (Show you a few things)
All pressed up in black and white
And you're dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things (Show you a few things)
Let me show you a few things (A few things)
Show you a few things about love, love, love
Let me show you a few things (A few things)
Show you a few things about love, hey
Oh!

Say Something Lyrics[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
Mhmm, yeah, alright
Ooh

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Everyone knows all about my direction
And in my heart somewhere I wanna go there
Still, I don't go there

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Everybody says, "Say something that says something”
“Say something that says something”
“Say something that says something”
I don't wanna get caught up in the rhythm of it
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have

[Verse 2: Chris Stapleton & Justin Timberlake]
Everyone knows all about my transgressions
Still in my heart somewhere, there's melody and harmony
For you and me tonight (Whoa)
I hear them call my name
[Chorus: Chris Stapleton & Justin Timberlake]
Everybody says, "Say something"
Then, "Say something, say something"
Then, "Say something, say something"
Then, "Say something"
I don't want to get caught up in the rhythm of it
But I can't get help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something is to say nothing

[Part-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
But I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it
[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)

Hey little mama
Ain't gotta ask me if I want to

TKO (Black Friday Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Justin Timberlake & (Timbaland)]
I don't understand it
Tell me, how could you be so low?
(And all in thrilling, new, living sound)
Dammit babe
(Dammit babe, dammit babe, dammit babe, dammit babe)

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Blood thicker than water, right
Fuck bitches, they all alike
Stand up nigga, not the fallin' type
Heart blacker than a Harlem night
Til I met you, they say the devil wear Prada
But I doubt it cause the Lord did bless you
Damn look at that body
Short bus shorty, cause it sure is special
Cole to the rescue, never save a ho
Hoes like to hide their behavior though
Thought you was a down ass bitch
'til I found that shit a couple days ago
I was home alone, next thing I know
That long ass verse from a song called "Control" was on
The room got nearer, the tune got clearer
That's when I seen the shit playing on your phone
Girl, what is that, a ringtone?
Shit, not you too
Man that hype done got you too
Everybody and their momma gassed
Even my momma asked what I'mma do
Decisions, decisions
In case this is war, then I load up on all ammunition
If a nigga want problems, my trigger's on auto
I'll make sure that nobody miss him
Now pack up your shit, you don't believe in me?
I don't need you, I got me, bitch
Same nigga moved to NYC, bitch
Got a record deal and a college degree, bitch
Two gold plaques, I produced all the tracks
And I never ever ever lean on Jay-Z, bitch
And after all that achievement
Real nigga never even went and got his teeth fixed
Now you try to play me, bitch?
You try to fuckin' play me? I ought to knock your ass out
[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & (Timbaland)]
TKO, I don't understand it, tell me how could you be so low damn(take out)
You've been swingin' after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest, perfect hit to the dome
Dammit babe
(Dammit babe, dammit babe, dammit babe, dammit babe)

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
All hail Pretty Flacko, bitch, celebrate it
Had the game on lock, streets serenaded
Now you lame mothafuckas lookin' devastated
Bet you niggas wish you never hated, that's the devil ain't it
Fuck that shit, he rich, fuck that shit, he this, fuck that shit, he that
He black, he don't like blacks, fuck that shit, he wack
Fuck that shit he raps, fuck that shit he spits, fuck that bitch
Fuck that bitch he with, finished talking shit? Get up off my dick
The nonsense is synonymous with comments from the blogs about
Menages with the gossips and the bosses, fuck surprises
I'm monogamous and not to mention, in my closet
Is a model chick, grimey gothic fits, trapped inside of it
Besides it I'd deny the shit shit, y'all should stop the shit
I'm the shit, not just kinda sick, the doc prescribed my shit
Cock it, click-click, opposite, stop and droppin' shit
'fore poppin' shit, from popular to poppin' picks to poppin' tits
She pop her pussy, pop a Xanny, popular for compliments
Make it rain, she pop that shit, it boosts her confidence
Was supposed to stop this shit but spit like I forgot some shit
Forgot the topic, I hope God forgive you, peep my common sense
[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & (Timbaland)]
TKO, I don't understand it, tell me how could you be so low
You've been swingin' after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest, perfect hit to the dome
Dammit babe
(Dammit babe, dammit babe, dammit babe, dammit babe)

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
JT this like deja vu right?
All this album of the year talk, niggas claimin' they're the best out
I been hot since the Purple Tape and this cuban's poking my chest out
They keep callin' on King Push, this beach chair, I'm stretched out
My name is my name, bitch, until I'm gone and it's etched out
I been known to blow a quarter brick on baby hairs and a messy bun
If I make her mine, I made her mind, she fall in line and we got some
Memoirs of a millionaire, even better I'm a reallionaire
Alaïa skirt, Fendi work, dress my baby like build-a-bear
Fuck you know about the type of rollie? Fuck you know about blowin' bands?
Bezel on it like a grand circle, diamonds in it, holdin' hands
A1 since day one, I sold dope and my name rung
I sold dope where I came from and it's so dope what I made from it
No lie, know why? Guy Fish in my bowtie
JT up in the three piece and we magic baby like showtime
She ain't know, we ain't know, try to trap her but she ain't slow
Once she trap you with the DA flow, it's lights out, TKO106Embed

Cry Me a River Lyrics[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
You were my sun, you were my earth
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no
So you took a chance, and made other plans
But I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
You don't have to say what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
Girl, I refuse, you must have me confused
With some other guy
The bridges were burned, now it's your turn, to cry
Cry me a river, cry me a river
Cry me a river, cry me a river (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
You know that they say some things are better left unsaid
It wasn't like you only talked to him and you know it
Don't act like you don't know it
And all of these things people told me
Keep messin' with my head (Messin' with my head)
Should've picked honesty
Then you may not have blown it
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
You don't have to say what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
Girl, I refuse, you must have me confused
With some other guy
The bridges were burned, now it's your turn, to cry
(Go on and just) Cry me a river
(Go on and just) Cry me a river
(Baby, go on and just) Cry me a river (Yeah, yeah)

[Bridge: Timbaland & Justin Timberlake]
Oh! (Oh! Well!) The damage is done
So I guess I'll be leaving (Oh, oh, oh!)
Oh! (Oh! Well!) The damage is done
So I guess I'll be leaving (Oh, oh, oh!)
Oh! (Oh! Well!) The damage is done
So I guess I'll be leaving (Oh, oh, oh!)
Oh! (Oh! Well!) The damage is done
So I guess I'll be l-l-l-l-l-leaving (Oh, oh, oh!)
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
You don't have to say what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Cry me a river (Go on and just), cry me a river
(Baby, go on and just)
Cry me a river (You can go on and just), cry me a river (Yeah, yeah)
Cry me a river (Baby, go on and just), cry me a river
(Go on and just)
Cry me a river (Come on baby, cry), cry me a river (don't wanna cry no more, yeah, yeah)
[Outro: Justin Timberlake]
Cry me a river, cry me a river
Oh, cry me a river, oh, cry me a river
Oh, cry me a river (Cry me, cry me), oh, cry me a river
(Cry me, cry me)
Oh, cry me a river (Cry me, cry me), oh, cry me a river
(Cry me, cry me)
Oh, cry me a river (Cry me, cry me), oh, cry me a river

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Baby, every day in training to get the gold
That’s why your body's crazy
But you can’t run from yourself, that’s where it’s difficult
Girl, I can see in your eyes that there’s something inside that made you evil
Where did you go? 'Cause it just ain't fair
Over here thinking 'bout the shit you say
Don't know why it gets to me

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
It cuts right on my heart, yeah, it hurt, won't lie
Still can't see, think I saw you with another guy
Fair fight, knocked down, then I got over you
Can't fight no more, you knock me out
What am I supposed to do?
[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I don't understand it
Tell me how could you be so low?
Been swinging after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest, perfect hit to the dome
Dammit, babe
This ain't the girl I used to know
No, not anymore, TKO

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Baby, now I really know what we're fighting for
This rematch sex is amazing
But nobody wins when if somebody’s heart is swole
'Cause when I see you move like you got something inside that made you lethal
Where did you go? It just ain't fair
Over here thinking 'bout the shit you do
Don't know what I got to lose
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
It cuts right on my heart, yeah, it hurt, won't lie
Still can't see, think I saw you with another guy
Fair fight, knocked down, then I got over you
Can't fight no more, you knock me out
What am I supposed to do?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I don't understand it
Tell me how could you be so low?

CAN’T STOP THE FEELING! Lyrics[Verse 1]
I got this feeling inside my bones
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flying up, no ceiling, when we in our zone

[Refrain]
I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops (ooh)
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop

[Pre-Chorus]
And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine (Just imagine, just imagine)

[Chorus]
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
A feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing
I can't stop the feeling!
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling!
So just dance, dance, dance
Come on
[Verse 2]
Ooh, it's something magical
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on
I don't need no reason, don't need control
I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone

[Refrain]
'Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops, ooh
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop

[Pre-Chorus]
And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine (Just imagine, just imagine)

[Chorus]
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
A feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing
I can't stop the feeling!
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling!
So just dance, dance, dance (Come on)
I can't stop the feeling!
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling!
So keep dancing
Come on
[Bridge]
Oh, yeah
I can't stop the, I can't stop the
I can't stop the, I can't stop the
I can't stop the feeling!

[Chorus]
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
(I can't stop the feeling!)
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
(I can't stop the feeling!)
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
(I can't stop the feeling!)
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing

[Outro]
Everybody sing
(I can't stop the feeling!)
Got this feeling in my body

Wanna see you move your body

Got this feeling in my body, come on
Break it down

I can't stop the feeling!
Got this feeling in my body, come on37Embed
