Girlfriend Lyrics[Intro]
Hey, let's talk
Please call back, bye

[Verse 1]
Told you I needed time, a little space
I packed up everything, all the stuff you left at my place
Moved back in with my mom, just had to get away
Tried to get used to it, waking up not seeing your face

[Pre-Chorus]
I went out (I went out)
Trying to forget about
Killed some time on the rebound
Where are you now?
'Cause nothing really feels like you

[Chorus]
I'm getting back with my girlfriend
Ready to dive in the deep end
This time, it's gonna be different
I'm getting back with my girlfriend (Oh)
Gonna call her, drive on over
Wanna see her, wanna hold her
It hit me all of a sudden
I'm getting back with my girlfriend
[Verse 2]
Friends think I'm naive
I don't care what they say 'cause I'm not listening
Need you like I need to breathe
Never liked the chase much anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
I went out
Trying to forget about
Killed some time on the rebound
Where are you now? (Where are you now?)
'Cause nothing really feels like you (No, no, no, no)

[Chorus]
I'm getting back with my girlfriend
Ready to dive in the deep end
This time, it's gonna be different
I'm getting back with my girlfriend
Gonna call her, drive on over
Wanna see her, wanna hold her
It hit me all of a sudden
I'm getting back with my girlfriend (Girlfriend)

[Bridge]
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
I wanna see her (Hey)
I've got a fever
'Cause I really want her back
Guess I'm gonna have to ask
I wanna see her (Wanna)
I've got a fever
'Cause I really want her back
I'm feeling it hard
[Chorus]
I'm getting back with my girlfriend (Yeah, yeah)
Ready to dive in the deep end (Yeah, yeah)
This time, it's gonna be different (It's gonna be)
I'm getting back with my girlfriend
Gonna call her, drive on over
Wanna see her, wanna hold her
It hit me all of a sudden
I'm getting back with my girlfriend

The Great Divide Lyrics[Verse 1]
You go where the wind blows
Destroying everyone in your path
I'm done feeding your ego
Forgetting everything that we had

[Pre-Chorus]
Funny how history ends in an instant
How something so close can end up so distant

[Chorus]
Dancing on the line of the great divide
Wash my hands, turn my back
I don't need the memories we had
I'm leaving you behind
Across the great divide

[Verse 2]
Good luck when you wake up
And realize all that you've lost
Shining lies are what you're made of
I hope it's worth the price that it cost

[Pre-Chorus]
Funny how history ends in an instant
How something so close can end up so distant
[Chorus]
Dancing on the line of the great divide
Wash my hands, turn my back
I don't need the memories we had
I'm leaving you behind
Across the great divide

[Bridge]
I let you go, so let me go
Let us go
I let you, I let you
I let you go, oh

[Chorus]
Dancing on the line of the great divide
Wash my hands, turn my back
I don't need the memories we had
I'm leaving you behind
Across the great divide

[Outro]
Mmm, the great divide
Hey, yeah5Embed

My Moment Lyrics[Verse 1]
Were you the one who said that I would be nothing?
Well, I'm about to prove you wrong
I'm not the only one who believes in something
My one wish is about to come true

I'm not stopping for you
No matter what you do
I'll just keep on dreaming
My head up in the clouds
When nobody is around to see

[Chorus]
This is my moment, my moment
It's my time, flying high-line, mine
Feels like my moment, my moment
I've waited for so long
But now everybody knows this is my moment

It's my time, flying high-line, mine
Feels like my moment, my moment
I've waited for so long
But now everybody knows this is my moment

[Verse 2]
You knew it all along, I was afraid of you
I thought I couldn't be myself
You tried to be my friend
But I wouldn't let you
Remember what you said
Don't miss out on your chance
Your life is in your hands
So take it just as far as you can
But trusting in yourself, forget everyone else
Believe!
[Chorus]
This is my moment, my moment
It's my time, flying high-line, mine
Feels like my moment, my moment
I've waited for so long
But now everybody knows this is my moment

It's my time, flying high-line, mine
Feels like my moment, my moment
I've waited for so long
But now everybody knows this is my moment

[Bridge]
Haters, said I'll see you later
Can't talk to you right now
I'm getting my paper
Said I'm doing big things
Things you never dreamed of
I hope you are happy cause I'm 'bout to blow up

[Chorus]
This is my moment, my moment
It's my time, flying high-line, mine
Feels like my moment, my moment
I've waited for so long
But now everybody knows this is my moment3Embed

Do You? Lyrics[Verse 1]
I need some recovery
Don't wanna make this messy
Push and pull again as you untie the ends
Baby, I need some recovery

[Verse 2]
Harder and harder to sleep
You're weighing heavy on me
Try and I try, can't push it aside
It's harder and harder to sleep

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you, do you know the things you do to me?
Do you, do you know the way that you sit on my couch
Staring silently, burning a hole in the wall

[Chorus]
Really got me
Where you want me
With my head just
Above the deep
Hear the sirens
Silent crying
Hard to be here
When you don't see me
[Verse 3]
Stuck in that weird in-between
Running through old memories
Felt it for ages, on different pages
Stuck in that weird in-between

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you, do you know the things you do to me?
Do you, do you know the way that you sit on my couch
Staring silently, burning a hole in the wall
While I'm trying to fix this, do you even care?

[Chorus]
Really got me
Where you want me
With my head just
Above the deep
Hear the sirens
Silent crying
Hard to be here
When you don't see me

[Outro]
I need some recovery
Don't wanna make this messy
Push and pull again as you untie the ends
Baby, I need some recovery1Embed

Worth It for the Feeling Lyrics[Verse 1]
Gotta be more careful with the shit I'm manifesting
Is this is all a dream or am I really being tested?
Out of five thousand people, of course you're standing there
Weighing all the options, running through my head
I think I'll take the chance, 'cause after all, what are the chances? (Just saying)

[Chorus]
Here we go again
Last time it took us down to the bitter end
I might need some more healing
But it's worth it for the feeling
Here we go again
Now I'm not looking back 'causе that pain is dead
If history's repeating
It's worth it for thе feeling

[Verse 2]
Might not look the same 'cause now we're both a little different
Had to find ourselves so we could find out what was missing
Gotta be honest, I'm scared to lose myself
After all the drama, I felt like someone else
But I'm stuck inside this dream, got trouble sleeping 'til we fix this

[Chorus]
Here we go again
Last time it took us down to the bitter end
I might need some more healing
But it's worth it for the feeling
Here we go again
Now I'm not looking back 'cause that pain is dead
If history's repeating
It's worth it for the feeling
[Bridge]
Forever, I've been asking for everyone's opinion
Never learned to trust my own intuition
Don't care if it's a bad decision

[Chorus]
Here we go again
Last time it took us down to the bitter end
I might need some more healing
But it's worth it for the feeling
Here we go again
Now I'm not looking back 'cause that pain is dead
If history's repeating
It's worth it for the feeling

Heart Full of Scars Lyrics[Verse 1]
Stop, don't tell me how to feel
These scars will never heal, overnight
I'm just searching for what's real
It's hard enough to deal with life

[Pre-Chorus]
Learn to say fuck it, take my time
Life's a bitch, but I'll make it mine
Make it, make it, make it mine
Learn to take it as a sign
If you don't like me, get in line
You won't break me, break me with your lies

[Chorus]
Sometimes you bleed for who you are
It's hard to love with a heart full of scars
I won't feed into your dark
I'll keep loving with a heart full of scars (heart full of scars)
You're never gonna keep me down
Doesn't really matter what you say
I'm not living for yesterday (heart full of scars)
I'll figure out how to turn it around
I'm learning how to bend not break
A full life is give not take (heart full of scars)
[Verse 2]
Done with doubt and overthinking
Wait for it to sink in, "I'm enough"
Sick of trying to be your perfect
The pain is never worth it, never was

[Pre-Chorus]
Learn to say fuck it, take my time
Life's a bitch but I'll make it mine
Make it, make it, make it mine
Learn to take it as a sign
If you don't like me get in line
You won't break me, break me with your lies

[Chorus]
Sometimes you bleed for who you are
It's hard to love with a heart full of scars
I won't feed into your dark
I'll keep loving with a heart full of scars (heart full of scars)
You're never gonna keep me down
Doesn't really matter what you say
I'm not living for yesterday (heart full of scars)
I'll figure out how to turn it around
I'm learning how to bend not break
A full life is give not take (heart full of scars)
[Breakdown]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Heart full of scars)
(Heart full of scars)
(Heart full of scars)

[Chorus]
You're never gonna keep me down
Doesn't really matter what you say
I'm not living for yesterday (heart full of scars)

Personal Lyrics[Verse 1]
She called me up, she had a hard night
Wanted some love to make her alright
I didn't know that in her mind
We were getting closer when really, we were over

[Pre-Chorus]
Possessive turned to passive in the middle of the night
Now in your vision, I'm the villain, you can't look me in the eyes
I watched your jealousy turn my sincerity
Into dishonesty, but I'll be the bigger person, babe

[Chorus]
I know you havе to hate me
Won't blame you if you blamе me
I promise even though it hurts
I won't take it personal
You've got some harbored feelings
Like I left you for no reason
I promise even though it hurts
I won't take it personal

[Verse 2]
It's for the best, the way it ended
I failed your test, rose-colored lenses
Are what you wore to hide the damage
But you can't fix glass when it's shattered in half
[Pre-Chorus]
Possessive turned to passive in the middle of the night
There's no going back to what we had, no rearranging time
'Cause all your jealousy turned my sincerity
Into dishonesty, but I'll be the bigger person, babe

[Chorus]
I know you have to hate me
Won't blame you if you blame me
I promise even though it hurts
I won't take it personal
You've got some harbored feelings
Like I left you for no reason
I promise even though it hurts
I won't take it personal

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
I wish I had known
You'd take it so personal
I wish you'd let it go
Don't take it so personal
I wish I had known
You'd take it so personal
Don't take it so personal1Embed

Foolish Lyrics[Verse 1]
Lipstick and Polaroids
Late night hanging with you, boy
Record player playing white noise
That's the way, that's the way I
Like it when the stars are out
Drop top cruising out of town
You and me, it's going down
That's the way, that's the way

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold me down, I'll play your game
Kiss until I, I
I'm addicted to your everything, everything

[Chorus]
My body's tripping on you
Feeling higher than the moon
Got me trying something new
Falling into you, foolish
My body's tripping on you
Feeling higher than the moon
Got me trying something new
Falling into you, foolish

[Verse 2]
Black nails and denim jeans
Every night feeling like a dream
Always know just what I need
That's the way, that's the way I
Like it when you play a little rough
Breathe you in, can't get enough
Keep it in, no need to rush
That's the way, that's the way
[Pre-Chorus]
Hold me down, I'll play your game
Kiss until I, I
I'm addicted to your everything, everything

[Chorus]
My body's tripping on you
Feeling higher than the moon
Got me trying something new
Falling into you, foolish
My body's tripping on you
Feeling higher than the moon
Got me trying something new
Falling into you, foolish

[Bridge]
Blurring all the lines, lost in paradise
Oh, oh
Wavy state of mind, fading out of time
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
My body's tripping on you
Feeling higher than the moon
Got me trying something new
Falling into you, foolish
My body's tripping on you
Feeling higher than the moon
Got me trying something new
Falling into you, foolish
[Outro]
Falling into you, foolish
Falling into you, foolish4Embed
