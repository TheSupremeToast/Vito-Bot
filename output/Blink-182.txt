I Miss You Lyrics[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you, I miss you
[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Hello, there
The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim
Of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night, we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
Where are you?
And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on, so haunting every time
And as I stare, I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight
[Chorus: Tom DeLonge and Mark Hoppus]
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge and Mark Hoppus]
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you183Embed

All the Small Things Lyrics[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
All the small things
True care, truth brings
I'll take one lift
Your ride, best trip
Always, I know
You'll be at my show
Watching, waiting
Commiserating

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home

[Post-Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
Late night, come home
Work sucks, I know
She left me roses by the stairs
Surprises let me know she cares
[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
Just say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home

[Post-Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill
The night will go on, my little windmill

[Outro: Tom DeLonge with Mark Hoppus]
(Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na)
Say it ain't so, I will not go
(Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na)
Turn the lights off, carry me home
(Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na)
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill

What’s My Age Again? Lyrics[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
I took her out, it was a Friday night
I wore cologne to get the feeling right
We started making out and she took off my pants
But then I turned on the TV

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus with Tom DeLonge]
And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
And are still more amused by TV shows
What the hell is ADD?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again? What's my age again?

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
Then later on, on the drive home
I called her mom from a payphone
I said I was the cops and your husband's in jail
This state looks down on sodomy

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus with Tom DeLonge]
And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
And are still more amused by prank phone calls
What the hell is call ID?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again? What's my age again?
[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus with Tom DeLonge]
And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
And you still act like you're in freshman year
What the hell is wrong with me?
My friends say I should act my age
(What's my age again? What's my age again?)
That's about the time that she broke up with me (Please stay with me)
No one should take themselves so seriously (Please stay with me)
With many years ahead to fall in line (Please stay with me)
Why would you wish that on me?
(Please stay) I never wanna act my age
(With) What's my age again? (Me) What's my age again?

Adam’s Song Lyrics[Verse 1]
I never thought I'd die alone
I laughed the loudest, who'd have known?
I trace the cord back to the wall
No wonder, it was never plugged in at all
I took my time, I hurried up
The choice was mine, I didn't think enough
I'm too depressed to go on
You'll be sorry when I'm gone

[Chorus]
I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

[Verse 2]
I never thought I'd die alone
Another six months, I'll be unknown
Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never step foot in my room again
You'll close it off, board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell Mom this is not her fault
[Chorus]
I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
I never conquered, rarely came
Tomorrow holds such better days
Days when I can still feel alive
When I can't wait to get outside
The world is wide, the time goes by
The tour is over, I've survived
And I can't wait 'til I get home
To pass the time in my room alone97Embed

Feeling This Lyrics[Intro]
Get ready for action!

[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge & (Mark Hoppus)]
I got no regret right now (I'm feelin' this!)
The air is so cold and null (I'm feelin' this!)
Let me go in her room (I'm feelin' this!)
I wanna take off her clothes (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the way to bed (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the way you move (I'm feelin' this!)
Fuck it, it's such a blur (I'm feelin' this!)
I love all the things you do (I'm feelin' this!)

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge & (Mark Hoppus)]
Where do we go from here?
Turn all the lights down now
Smiling from ear to ear (I'm feelin' this!)
Our breathing's got too loud (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the bedroom floor (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the bathroom mirror (I'm feelin' this!)
We're taking this way too slow (I'm feelin' this!)
Take me away from here (I'm feelin' this!)
[Chorus: Mark Hoppus, Tom DeLonge, Both]
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna

[Bridge: Mark Hoppus]
This place was never the same again after you
Came and went, how could you say you meant anything
Different to anyone standing alone on the
Street with a cigarette on the first night we met
Look to the past and remember and smile
And maybe tonight I can breathe for a while
I'm not in this scene, I think I'm falling asleep
But then all that it means is I'll always be dreaming of you

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus, Tom DeLonge, Both]
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer (So lost and disillusioned)
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna (So lost and disillusioned)
Fate fell short this time (Are we alone? Do you feel it?)
Your smile fades in the summer (So lost and disillusioned)
Place your hand in mine (Are we alone? Do you feel it?)
I'll leave when I wanna (So lost and disillusioned)
Fate fell short this time (Are we alone? Do you feel it?)
Your smile fades in the summer (So lost and disillusioned)
Place your hand in mine (Are we alone? Do you feel it?)
I'll leave when I wanna (So lost and disillusioned)20Embed

Dammit Lyrics[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
It's alright to tell me what you think about me
I won't try to argue or hold it against you
I know that you're leaving, you must have your reasons
The season is calling, your pictures are falling down

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
The steps that I retrace, the sad look on your face
The timing and structure, did you hear he fucked her?
A day late, a buck short, I'm writing the report
On losing and failing, when I move, I'm flailing now

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
And it's happened once again, I'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands, and sees through the master plan
But everybody's gone, and I've been here for too long
To face this on my own, well, I guess this is growing up

[Post-Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
Well, I guess this is growing up

[Verse 3: Mark Hoppus]
And maybe I'll see you at a movie sneak preview
You'll show up and walk by on the arm of that guy
And I'll smile and you'll wave, we'll pretend it's okay
The charade, it won't last, when he's gone, I won't come back
[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
And it'll happen once again, you'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands and sees through the master plan
But everybody's gone, and you've been there for too long
To face this on your own, well, I guess this is growing up

She’s Out of Her Mind Lyrics[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
I said, "Settle down, settle down, everything is fine
Take your eyes off the floor"
She said, "No, I'm not, no, I'm not, no, I'm not alright
I lost my head on the door"

[Pre-Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
She's a-a-a-antisocial, a-a-a-antisocial
A-a-and she's an angel, yeah

[Chorus: Matt Skiba and Mark Hoppus]
I'm in deep with this girl, but she's out of her mind
She said "Babe, I'm sorry, but I'm crazy tonight"
She got a black shirt, black skirt, and Bauhaus stuck in her head
I'm in deep with this girl, but she's out of her mind, oh yeah

[Post-Chorus: Mark Hoppus and Matt Skiba]
We all need something to live for, oh yeah
We all need something to live for

[Verse 2: Matt Skiba]
She said, "I let her down, let her down, I no longer dream
Of anything anymore"
Said I'm a know-it-all, know-it-all, "You make me want to scream"
And threw herself on the floor
[Pre-Chorus: Matt Skiba]
She's a-a-a-antisocial, a-a-a-antisocial
A-a-a she's an angel, yeah

[Bridge: Mark Hoppus]
She's not complicated, can't be overstated at all
She's not complicated-ated-ated at all

[Chorus: Matt Skiba and Mark Hoppus]
I'm in deep with this girl, but she's out of her mind
(She's out of her mind)
She said "Babe, I'm sorry but I'm crazy tonight"
She got a black shirt, black skirt, and Bauhaus stuck in her head

First Date Lyrics[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
In the car, I just can't wait
To pick you up on our very first date
Is it cool if I hold your hand?
Is it wrong if I think it's lame to dance?
Do you like my stupid hair?
Would you guess that I didn't know what to wear?
I'm too scared of what you think
You make me nervous, so I really can't eat

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
Let's go, don't wait, this night's almost over
Honest, let's make this night last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
When you smile, I melt inside
I'm not worthy for a minute of your time
I really wish it was only me and you
I'm jealous of everybody in the room
Please don't look at me with those eyes
Please don't hint that you're capable of lies
I dread the thought of our very first kiss
A target that I'm probably gonna miss
[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
Let's go, don't wait, this night's almost over
Honest, let's make this night last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
Let's go, don't wait, this night's almost over

Bored To Death Lyrics[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
There's an echo pulling out the meaning
Rescuing a nightmare from a dream
The voices in my head are always screaming
That none of this means anything to me

[Pre-Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
And I...
I'm not coming home

[Chorus: Matt Skiba and Mark Hoppus]
Save your breath, I'm nearly bored to death, and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on earth I'm broken, lost and cold, and fading fast
Life is too short to last long

[Verse 2: Matt Skiba]
There's a stranger staring at the ceiling
Rescuing a tiger from a tree
The pictures in her head are always dreaming
Each of them means everything to me

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Skiba]
And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
And I...
I'm not coming home
[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
Save your breath, I'm nearly bored to death, and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on earth I'm broken, lost and cold, and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
[Bridge: Mark Hoppus and Matt Skiba]
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
I think I met her at the minute that the rhythm was set down
I said, "I'm sorry I'm a bit of a let down"
But all my friends are daring me to come over
So I come over and over and over
So let me buy you a drink, and we'll pretend that you think
That I'm the man of your dreams come to life in a dive bar
And we'll go over and over and over
And we'll go over and over and over
And we'll go over and over and over
And we'll go over and over and over

[Chorus: Matt Skiba and Mark Hoppus]
Save your breath, I'm nearly bored to death, and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on earth I'm broken, lost and cold, and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
[Outro: Matt Skiba (Mark Hoppus)]
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh (life is too short to last long)

Stay Together for the Kids Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
It's hard to wake up
When the shades have been pulled shut
This house is haunted, it's so pathetic
It makes no sense at all
I'm ripe with things to say
The words rot and fall away
What stupid poem could fix this home?
I'd read it every day

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time, you gave it all away
It was mine, so when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night, twenty years now lost?

[Post-Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
It's not right...

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
Their anger hurts my ears
Been running strong for seven years
Rather than fix the problems
They never solve them, it makes no sense at all
I see them everyday
We get along, so why can't they?
If this is what he wants
And it's what she wants, then why is there so much pain?
[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time, you gave it all away
It was mine, so when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night, twenty years now lost?
