Sweet Child O’ Mine Lyrics[Instrumental Intro/Guitar Riff]

[Verse 1]
She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky (Sky)
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long I'd probably break down and cry

[Chorus]
Woah-oh-oh! Sweet child o' mine
Woah, oh-oh-oh! Sweet love of mine
[Post-Chorus Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by

[Chorus]
Woah-oh-oh! Sweet child o' mine
Ooh, oh-oh-oh! Sweet love of mine
[Post-Chorus Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Oh yeah! Woah-oh-oh-oh! Sweet child o' mine
Ooh-oh, oh, oh! Sweet love of mine
Woah, oh-oh-oh! Sweet child o' mine, ooh yeah
Ooh! Sweet love of mine
[Guitar Solo]

Welcome to the Jungle Lyrics[Intro]
Oh my God
Jump

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the jungle, we got fun and games
We got everything you want, honey, we know the names
We are the people that can find whatever you may need
If you got the money, honey, we got your disease

[Chorus 1]
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your shun-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n, knees, knees
Mwah, ah, I wanna watch you bleed

[Verse 2]
Welcome to the jungle, we take it day by day
If you want it you're going to bleed, but it's the price you pay
And you're a very sexy girl, it's very hard to please
You can taste the bright lights, but you won't get there for free

[Chorus 2]
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Feel my, my, my, my serpentine
Oh, ah, I wanna hear you scream
[Interlude]
Moaning

[Verse 3]
Welcome to the jungle, it gets worse here everyday
You learn to live like an animal in the jungle where we play
If you got a hunger for what you see, you'll take it eventually
You can have anything you want, but you better not take it from me

[Chorus 1]
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your shun-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n, knees, knees
Mwah, I wanna watch you bleed

[Bridge]
And when you're high, you never
Ever want to come down
So down, so down, so down, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

You know where you are?
You're in the jungle, baby
You're gonna die
[Chorus Extended]
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your shun-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n, knees, knees
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Feel my, oh my, my, my serpentine
Jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your shun-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n, knees, knees

November Rain Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But, darlin', when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same? Yeah...

[Chorus 1]
'Cause nothing lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain

[Verse 2]
We've been through this such a long, long time
Just tryna kill the pain, ooh yeah
But lovers always come and lovers always go
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today, walkin' away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head, just knowin' that you were mine, all mine

[Chorus 2]
So, if you want to love me
Then, darlin', don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain
[Refrain]
Do you need some time on your own?
Do you need some time all alone?
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?

[Bridge]
I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you, woah-woah
[Guitar Solo 1]

[Refrain]
Sometimes, I need some time on my own
Sometimes, I need some time all alone
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?
[Guitar Solo 2]

[Verse 3]
And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain, ooh yeah
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame
[Chorus 3]
So, never mind the darkness
We still can find a way
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Even cold November rain
[Guitar Solo 3]

[Outro]
Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one, you're not the only one
Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one, you're not the only one
Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one, you're not the only one
Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?

Civil War Lyrics[Spoken Intro: Strother Martin ]
What we've got here is failure to communicate
Some men, you just can't reach
So, you get what we had here, last week
Which is the way he wants it
Well, he gets it
*Whistling*
And I don't like it any more than you men

[Intro]
Look at your young men fighting
Look at your women crying
Look at your young men dying
The way they've always done before
Look at the hate we're breeding
Look at the fear we're feeding
Look at the lives we're leading
The way we've always done before

[Verse 1]
My hands are tied
The billions shift from side to side
An' the wars go on with brainwashed pride
For the love of God and our human rights
An' all these things are swept aside
By bloody hands, time can't deny
An' are washed away by your genocide
An' history hides the lies of our civil wars
[Guitar Solo 1]

[Pre-Chorus 1]
D'you wear a black armband when they shot the man
Who said peace could last forever?
An' in my first memories, they shot Kennedy
I went numb when I learned to see
So I never fell for Vietnam
We got the wall in D.C. to remind us all
That you can't trust freedom when it's not in your hands
When everybody's fightin' for their promised land

[Chorus]
And I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich, while it buries the poor
Your power hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh? I don't need your civil war
Ooh, no, no, no, no, no, no

[Bridge]
Look at the shoes you're filling
Look at the blood we're spilling
Look at the world we're killing
The way we've always done before
Look in the doubt we've wallowed
Look at the leaders we've followed
Look at the lies we've swallowed
An' I don't want to hear no more
[Verse 2]
My hands are tied
For all, I've seen has changed my mind
But still, the wars go on, as the years go by
With no love of God or human rights
An' all these dreams are swept aside
By bloody hands of the hypnotized
Who carry the cross of homicide
And history bears the scars of our civil wars

[Guitar Solo 2]

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We practice selective annihilation
Of mayors and government officials
For example, to create a vacuum
Then we fill that vacuum
As popular war advances
Peace is closer

[Chorus]
I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich, while it buries the poor
Your power hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh? I don't need your civil war
No no no no no no no no no no no no
I don't need your civil war
I don't need your civil war
Your power hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh? I don't need your civil war
No no no no no no no no no no, no, no
I don't need one more war
Ooh, I don't need one more war
No no no, no woah, no woah

Paradise City Lyrics[Chorus]
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
(Take me home) Oh, won't you please take me home?
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
(Take me home) Oh, won't you please take me home?

[Verse 1]
Just an urchin living under the street, I'm a
Hard case that's tough to beat
I'm your charity case, so buy me something to eat
I'll pay you at another time, take it to the end of the line
Rags and riches, or so they say, you gotta
Keep pushing for the fortune and fame
You know it's, it's all a gamble when it's just a game
You treat it like a capital crime, everybody's doing the time

Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home? Yeah-yeah
Take me down to the Paradise City

[Verse 2]
Strapped in the chair of the city's gas chamber
Why I'm here, I can't quite remember
The Surgeon General says it's hazardous to breathe
I'd have another cigarette
But I can't see, tell me who you're gonna believe
[Chorus]
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home, yeah-yeah
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home, oh yeah

He's a court jester with a broken heart
He said, "Turn me around and take me back to the start"

Patience Lyrics[Intro]
One, two, one, two, three, four
*Whistling*

[Verse 1]
Shed a tear 'cause I'm missin' you, I'm still alright to smile
Girl, I think about you every day now
Was a time when I wasn't sure, but you set my mind at ease
There is no doubt you're in my heart now

[Chorus]
Said, woman, take it slow and it'll work itself out fine
All we need is just a little patience
Said, sugar, make it slow and we'll come together fine
All we need is just a little patience
Patience, mm yeah...

[Verse 2]
I sit here on the stairs 'cause I'd rather be alone
If I can't have you right now, I'll wait, dear
Sometimes I get so tense, but I can't speed up the time
But you know, love, there's one more thing to consider

[Chorus]
Said, woman, take it slow and things will be just fine
You and I'll just use a little patience
Said, sugar, take the time 'cause the lights are shinin' bright
You and I've got what it takes to make it
We won't fake it, aw, I'll never break it, 'cause I can't take it

Just tryin' to get it right (A little patience)
It's hard to see with so many around (Yeah)
You know I don't like bein' stuck in the crowd (Could use some patience)
An' the streets don't change, but maybe the names (Yeah)
I ain't got time for the game 'cause I need you (Gotta have more patience)
Yeah-yeah, but I need you (Yeah)
Ooh, I need you (All it takes is patience)
Oh, I need you (Just a little patience)

One in a Million Lyrics[Verse 1]
Guess I needed some time to get away
I needed some peace of mind, some peace of mind that'll stay
So I thumbed it down to 6th in L.A
Maybe a Greyhound could be my way
Police and niggers, that's right, get out of my way
Don't need to buy none of your gold chains today
Now, don't need no bracelets clamped in front of my back
Just need my ticket, 'til then, won't you cut me some slack

[Chorus]
You're one in a million, yeah, that's what you are
You're one in a million, babe, you're a shooting star
Maybe someday we'll see you before you make us cry
You know we tried to reach you but you were much too high
Much too high, much too high, much too high

[Verse 2]
Immigrants and faggots, they make no sense to me
They come to our country and think they'll do as they please
Like start some mini Iran or spread some fucking disease
They talk so many God damn ways, it's all Greek to me
Well, some say I'm lazy and others say that's just me
Some say I'm crazy, I guess I'll always be
But it's been such a long time since I knew right from wrong
It's all the means to and end, I, I keep it moving along
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
[Chorus]
You're one in a million, yeah, you're a shooting star
You're one in a million, babe, you know that you are
Maybe some day we'll see you before you make us cry
You know we tried to reach you but you were much too high
Much too high, much too high, much too high, oh

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Radicals and racists, don't point your finger at me
I'm a small town white boy just trying to make ends meet
Don't need your religion, don't watch that much TV
Just making my living, baby, well, that's enough for me

[Chorus]
You're one in a million, yeah, you know that you are
You're one in a million, babe, you're a shooting star
Maybe someday we'll see you before you make us cry
You know we tried to reach you but you were much too high
Much too high, much too high, oh, much too high

Rocket Queen Lyrics[Verse 1]
If I say I don't need anyone, I can say these things to you
'Cause I can turn on anyone just like I've turned on you
I've got a tongue like a razor, a sweet switchblade knife
And I can do you favors but then you'll do whatever I like

[Chorus]
Here I am, and you're a Rocket Queen
I might be a little young, but, honey, I ain't naive
Here I am, and you're a Rocket Queen, oh yeah
I might be too much, but, honey, you're a bit obscene

[Verse 2]
I've seen everything imaginable pass before these eyes
I've had everything that's tangible, honey, you'd be surprised
I'm a sexual innuendo in this burned out paradise
If you turn me on to anything, you better turn me on tonight

[Chorus]
Here I am, and you're a Rocket Queen
I might be a little young, but, honey, I ain't naive
Here I am, and you're a Rocket Queen, oh yeah

[Bridge]
I see you standin', standin' on your own
It's such a lonely place for you, for you to be
If you need a shoulder or if you need a friend
I'll be here standing until the bitter end
No one needs the sorrow, no one needs the pain
I hate to see you walking out there out in the rain
So, don't chastise me or think I, I mean you harm
Of those that take you leave you strung out much too far
Baby, yeah, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, baby, yeah
