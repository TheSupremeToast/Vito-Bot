Runaway Lyrics[Intro]
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)

[Verse 1]
I was listenin' to the ocean
I saw a face in the sand
But when I picked it up
Then it vanished away from my hands, dah
I had a dream I was seven
Climbin' my way in a tree
I saw a piece of heaven
Waitin' in patience for me, dah

[Pre-Chorus]
And I was runnin' far away
Would I run off the world someday?
Nobody knows, nobody knows
And I was dancing in the rain
I felt alive and I can't complain

[Chorus]
But no, take me home
Take me home where I belong
I can't take it anymore

[Verse 2]
I was painting a picture
The picture was a painting of you
And for a moment I thought you were here
But then again, it wasn't true, dah
And all this time I have been lyin'
Oh, lyin' in secret to myself
I've been putting sorrow on the farthest place on my shelf
La-di-da
[Pre-Chorus]
And I was runnin' far away
Would I run off the world someday?
Nobody knows, nobody knows
And I was dancing in the rain
I felt alive and I can't complain

[Chorus]
But no, take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
No, take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
No, take me home
Take me home where I belong
I can't take it anymore

[Bridge]
But I kept runnin' for a soft place to fall
And I kept runnin' for a soft place to fall
And I kept runnin' for a soft place to fall
And I kept runnin' for a soft place to fall

[Pre-Chorus]
And I was runnin' far away
Would I run off the world someday?
[Chorus]
But no, take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
No, take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go

[Outro]
No, take me home, home where I belong, no, no
No, take me home, home where I belong, oh, oh, oh
No, take me home, home where I belong, no, no
No, take me home, home where I belong
I can't take it anymore93Embed

Running with the Wolves Lyrics[Verse 1]
Go row the boat to safer grounds
But don't you know we're stronger now
My heart still beats and my skin still feels
My lungs still breathe, my mind still fears
But we're runnin' out of time (Time, ah)
All the echoes in my mind cry

[Pre-Chorus]
There's blood on your lies
The skies open wide
There is nowhere for you to hide
The hunter's moon is shinin'

I'm running with the wolves tonight

Trick or treat, what would it be?
I walk alone, I'm everything
My ears can hear and my mouth can speak
My spirit talks, I know my soul believes

All the echoes in my mind cry

There's blood on your lies
The skies open wide
There is nowhere for you to hide

A gift, a curse
They track and hurt
Say, can you dream
In nightmares seems?
A million voices, silent dreams
Where hope is left so incomplete

The Seed Lyrics[Verse 1]
Just like the seed
I don't know where to go
Through dirt and shadow, I grow
I'm reaching light through the struggle
Just like the seed
I'm chasing the wonder
I unravel myself
All in slow motion

[Chorus]
You cannot eat money, oh no
You cannot eat money, oh no
When the last tree has fallen
And the rivers are poisoned
You cannot eat money, oh no
You cannot eat money, oh no
You cannot eat money, oh no
When the last tree has fallen
And the rivers are poisoned
You cannot eat money, oh no
Oh no

[Verse 2]
Suffocate me
So my tears can be rain
I will water the ground where I stand
So the flowers can grow back again
'Cause just like the seed
Everything wants to live
We are burning our fingers
But we learn and forgive, ah
[Chorus]
You cannot eat money, oh no
You cannot eat money, oh no
When the last tree has fallen
And the rivers are poisoned
You cannot eat money, oh no
You cannot eat money, oh no
You cannot eat money, oh no
When the last tree has fallen
And the rivers are poisoned
You cannot eat money, oh no
Oh no

[Bridge]
Feed me sunlight, feed me air
(In a place where nothing matters)
Feed me truth and feed me prayer
(Dancing around a shooting star)
(And every cell remembers what have taken us this far)
Feed me sunlight, feed me air
(I see images of killer whales)
Feed me truth and feed me prayers
(Sleeping in a desert trail)
(Dreaming of a parallel world where nothing ever hurts)
(Dreaming of a parallel world where nothing ever hurts)
[Chorus]
You cannot eat money, oh no
You cannot eat money, oh no
When the last tree has fallen
And the rivers are poisoned
You cannot eat money, oh no
You cannot eat money, oh no
You cannot eat money, oh no
When the last tree has fallen
And the rivers are poisoned
You cannot eat money, oh no

Open ground, the sky is open, makes an open scene (Oh, oh)

Just like in fiction, in every addiction (Oh, oh)

Winter Bird Lyrics[Verse 1]
Walking in my sleep
Like the naked trees
Will they wake up again?
Do they sleep, do they dream?
Feel it as the wind strokes my skin
I am moved by the chill
Hear the winter bird sin

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

[Chorus]
My tears are always frozen
I can see the air I breathe
Got my fingers painting pictures
On the glass in front of me
Lay me by the frozen river
Where the boats have passed me by
All I need is to remember
How it was to feel alive

[Verse 2]
Silent days, violent shades
We are dancing again
In a dream, by the lake

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

My tears are always frozen

On the glass in front of me
Lay me by the frozen river
Where the boats have passed me by
All I need is to remember
How it was to feel alive

Rest against my pillow like the ageing winter sun
Only wake each morning to remember that you're gone
So I drift away again
To winter I belong

Lay me by the frozen river

My tears are always frozen (Ah, ah-ah, ah ah)

Forgotten Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Can you tell if I'm cold?
If I'm out of daydreams?
If I lose what is loved
Will a new love awake me?
I am touched by wonder
When I'm blind in the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
But you drown me in daylight
Don't swim with me darling
I prefer the sound of you
When you are away

[Chorus]
If I am left with a rose in my hand, let it die
It's the beauty in forgotten love
And I don't care if you don't understand why I cry
It's the beauty in forgotten love

[Verse 2]
I forget how emotions dance when they aren't inside of me
I forget how the sun feels when she isn't around me
And my dreams become sweeter when something is missing
I'm in love with the hunt itself
It makes me feel alive, alive
[Chorus]
If I am left with a rose in my hand, let it die
It's the beauty in forgotten love
And I don't care if you don't understand why I cry
It's the beauty in forgotten love

I release my body and there is no ghost of you inside my mind
I am moving on and thank God you let me try
You are the reason I can dance
Within a fire of goodbyes, of goodbyes
I can lie in a dark room without the feeling that I'm lonely
Oh, (It's the beauty in forgotten love)

[Chorus]
If I am left with a rose in my hand, let it die
It's the beauty in forgotten love
And I don't care if you don't understand why I cry

It Happened Quiet Lyrics[Verse 1]
Eyes blue and hollow
As it rains against their will
Feathers falling out of a pillow
As if time's standing still

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can't remember much more
But I know it happened quiet
So quiet

[Chorus]
Words falling out through the window
All that remains is a silent call
Is the Earth colored red?
As I land like a flower on the meadow
Love is wild

[Verse 2]
You fell apart
Like a stone can be broken into sand
A thousand pieces
Spread across a crying land

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And you can't remember that day
But you know it happened quiet
So quiet
[Chorus]
Words falling out through the window
All that remains is a silent call
Is the Earth colored red?
As I land like a flower on the meadow
Love is wild

[Bridge]
Are your dreams as dead as they seem?
Are your dreams as dead as they seem?

[Chorus]
Don't you speak over my voice
I will return from the shadows
And I'll bleed in your bed
Turn it red
Like the ground outside your window
Love is wild

Love is wild
Love is wild
Love is wild
Love is wild25Embed

The River Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hold your hands up to your chest
And tell me what you find
Out of you, a sparrow comes
And sees without its eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't forget who you are even though you are hurt
You are caught in a wire and soon it will burst

You can cry, drinking your eyes
Do you miss the sadness when it is gone? (Gone)
And you let the river run wild (Gone)
And you let the river run wild

[Verse 2]
I'm a shadow, I am cold
And now I seek for warmth
Stitch your skin onto my skin
And we won't be alone

Don't forget who you are even though you're in need
Like a bird in the night, your emotions deserves to be freed

You can cry, drinking your eyes
Do you miss the sadness when it is gone? (Gone)
And you let the river run wild (Gone)
And you let the river run wild
You can cry (You can cry), drinking your eyes

To where the ocean is bigger

I fall asleep in my own tears
I cry for the world, for everyone
And I build a boat to float in

And I built a cage to hide in
